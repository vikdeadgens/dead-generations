1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,775
It's funny. Visiting Final Fantasy 7 Remake
nearly 20 years after playing the

2
00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:08,696
original release *really* put into
perspective how much of the original

3
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:12,056
just went over my head when I first
played it.

4
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:15,976
Because when Square presented a premise of
terrorists against an evil mega-corporation

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,896
corporation to a sheltered boy--
that boy being me--

6
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:24,616
I saw Robin Hood versus the Sheriff of
Nottingham, or the Rebel Alliance versus

7
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:28,136
the Galactic Empire.
To me, this starting point was more a

8
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:33,576
means to an end, with the "end" being
cool battles, cool set pieces, and an even

9
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:38,215
cooler silver-maned villain introduced in
the first few hours of playtime.

10
00:00:38,239 --> 00:00:42,055
Now, 20 years after my original
playthrough, I went into Remake with

11
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:47,015
better critical thinking skills, a little
more worldliness, and--of course--

12
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:51,336
a longstanding adderall prescription.
I became positioned like a goalie,

13
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:55,175
arms up and ready to intercept whatever
Remake threw at me.

14
00:00:55,199 --> 00:01:03,096
And when the dust of my Remake playthrough
settled, what do you think I found in my hand?

15
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:04,616
Radical left...

16
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:06,536
*politics...?*

17
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:10,536
[Music]

18
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:12,376
dead generations presents

19
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:19,415
Is Final Fantasy VII a Radical, Left-Wing
Game?

20
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:25,496
Hello, I'm Vik for dead generations and in
this video, i plan to go on a journey with you.

21
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:28,216
At the end of our journey we'll find an
answer to the question in the video

22
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:33,256
title, which we'll uncover by first
exploring the following two assertions:

23
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:37,256
1. There is a radical heart to
Final Fantasy VII.

24
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:42,775
and 2. Final Fantasy VII reflects
real-life radical left politics.

25
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:46,856
Before I go on, I will warn you that this
video contains extensive spoilers for

26
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:51,576
the entire Compilation of Final Fantasy
VII, which includes the original game,

27
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:57,816
Remake, InterMISSION, and other sequels,
prequels, spin-offs... Kingdom Hearts...

28
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:59,496
The Kids Are All Right...

29
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:04,616
I've read through a lot of articles, essays, book
chapters, and manifestos to write this video,

30
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:08,776
and you can see a list of the references
linked in the description below.

31
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:12,136
For the most part i tried to make sure
my sources weren't paywalled, and I

32
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:17,096
invite you to read, scrutinize, and most
importantly, *use* my sources as a

33
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:20,776
breadcrumb trail to learn more about
the stuff that I talk about.

34
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:24,776
That said feel free to teach me a thing
or ten in the comments,

35
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:27,016
especially if i've gotten something
wrong.

36
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:34,056
I have also added subtitles, time stamps, a
transcript, and all that fun stuff so take advantage!

37
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:42,935
Now, let's begin by taking a closer look at the
foundational elements of Final Fantasy VII's world building.

38
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:48,136
Chapter 1: Shinra and the Shitty pizza

39
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:51,976
Barret: "The upper world...a city on a plate...

40
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,816
It's 'cuz of that shitty 'pizza', that
people underneath are sufferin'!

41
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:57,656
And the city below is full of polluted air.

42
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:02,776
On topa that the reactor keeps
drainin' up all the energy."

43
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:07,096
Cloud: "Then why doesn't
everyone move on to the Plate?"

44
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:12,376
"Barret: Dunno. probably 'cuz they
ain't got no money. Or, maybe..."

45
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:17,495
'Cuz they love their land,
no matter how polluted it gets."

46
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:21,736
"Cloud: I know... no one lives in
the slums because they want to.

47
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:30,376
It's like this train. It can't run
anywhere except where its rails take it."

48
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:33,336
Remake introduces you to its most
prominent villain in the first few

49
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:37,736
minutes of gameplay. The Shinra Electric
Power Company, a mega-corporation that

50
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:41,495
literally uses the planet's lifeblood
to power their reactors.

51
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:45,256
You're also introduced to remake's
rendition of one of the most memorable

52
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:49,176
locations in all of video games: the city
of Midgar

53
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:50,696
There's an elevated section where

54
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:55,336
affluent and middle-class people live,
hundreds of feet above ground, and a

55
00:03:55,360 --> 00:04:02,056
ground-level section littered with debris,
pollution, and of course poor people.

56
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:05,336
As the Midgar section of the game's
story progresses, you learn more about

57
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:09,656
the way the Shinra Company's remit is
closer to that of the nation-state than

58
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:12,855
that of the typical evil corporation:

59
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:16,376
It employs a large number of
Midgar's residents.

60
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:21,495
It maintains a police force in the form
of the Shinra Public Security Forces.

61
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:25,895
It builds housing and infrastructure for
the city's residents.

62
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:30,776
It deploys its own paramilitary forces
in the form of SOLDIER and spies in the

63
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:35,016
form of the Turks in shady interventions
around the world.

64
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:41,496
It's even publicly engaged in a war with
Wutai, another nation-state.

65
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:49,496
Midgar does have a Mayor, Domino who is more a Shinra
Company figurehead than a legitimate civil authority.

66
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:54,216
Let's begin to put all this into a wider
cultural and historic context. First off

67
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:57,175
a question i'm sure is on all of our
minds right now:

68
00:04:57,199 --> 00:04:59,175
what's a city, anyway?

69
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:04,455
I'm going to draw heavily from Chapter 1
of 2017's Cities of Power by sociologist

70
00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:08,696
Göran Therborn for this section and
everything I'll reference can be read,

71
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:13,256
for free, via Google Books Preview.
Link in the description below.

72
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:17,015
Now, Therborn begins with a quote by
the historian Lewis Mumford that seems

73
00:05:17,039 --> 00:05:21,496
to be a succinct explanation that even a
toddler can understand.

74
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:27,175
A city is... um...

75
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:32,936
"a point of maximum concentration for the
power and culture of a community."

76
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:36,296
While Cities of Power is mostly
concerned with surveying real-world

77
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:42,696
capital cities, some of the lessons of that first chapter
are generalizable enough to our discussion on Midgar.

78
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:47,015
In the Mumford quote, "Power" has political
and economic dimensions.

79
00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:51,416
We can understand "political power" as the
authority granted "by coercion and or

80
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:55,256
persuasion through institutions and
processes of government."

81
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:59,895
To contextualize Therborn's definition:
I live in a city, and I have no choice

82
00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:04,216
but to defer to the political power
wielded by my city government in the

83
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:08,856
form of its management of public
utilities, command over an army of cops,

84
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:13,656
its maintenance of the sidewalks and
roads I use to travel, and so on.

85
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:17,416
Relevant to us is the idea that
political power in cities can exist

86
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:22,295
alongside political counter-power, which
might take the form of protest rallies,

87
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:25,816
opposition movement headquarters, and
so on.

88
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:29,976
We can understand "economic power" as the
concentration of capital--

89
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:34,295
engines of production like factories--
and wealth.

90
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:38,376
Power shapes cities in very important
ways including spatially.

91
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:42,615
For example, if a city center is secluded
from the periphery of a city, we can

92
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:47,576
infer an element of social exclusivity.
Therborn's characteristic example

93
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:51,895
being former South African apartheid
cities which had undeveloped wastelands

94
00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:55,976
separating non-white townships from
white city centers.

95
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,816
Even topography can be interpreted as a
power gradient.

96
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:02,136
Therborn specifically cites pre-modern

97
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:07,256
Edo, Japan, which saw lords living on
hills and their retinue below them.

98
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:13,416
Our understanding of Midgar as a concentration of
power starts with three words: the Shinra Company

99
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:17,816
1. The company provides reactors and
manufacturing facilities, and is where

100
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:20,776
the majority of the city's wealth is
tied.

101
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:25,336
2. Politically, we recall that the
Shinra Company effectively acts as

102
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:29,656
Midgar's government, providing public
services and infrastructure, in addition

103
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:32,295
to having the city's Mayor in their
pocket.

104
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:35,656
Importantly, we should try to recognize
the existence of a political

105
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:40,295
counter-power in Midgar. The name escapes
me right now, but I'm thinking of an

106
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:44,376
environmental phenomenon, and I can't
quite recall it.

107
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:48,216
What? You're saying that I should know
since I wrote the script to this video?

108
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:49,575
Oh, you.

109
00:07:49,599 --> 00:07:52,776
Anyway, let's come back to that one a
little later.

110
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:56,696
We've placed Midgar in a sociopolitical
context, and in doing this we've

111
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:58,696
reaffirmed the outsized role of the

112
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:03,256
Shinra Company as the city's literal and
figurative source of power.

113
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:07,816
Let's talk about this relationship. The
evil corporation is well-trodden ground

114
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:11,976
in fiction around the world, and it's
easy to see the trope as a sort of

115
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:16,776
creative rebellion against the omnipresence
of corporations in our day-to-day lives.

116
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:20,216
If you're watching this video you've
probably encountered charts like this

117
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:28,056
one, created by Oxfam in 2014, which shows us that
10 companies own a lot of food sold at supermarkets.

118
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:32,056
But more than a creative rebellion, the
trope is predicated on actual harmful

119
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:35,495
practices corporations have historically
engaged in.

120
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:39,096
We can relate a few examples to Shinra
and Midgar.

121
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:43,575
1. Company towns. Defined as a
town with its buildings, amenities, and

122
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:47,576
businesses being owned by a single
company, and particularly prevalent in

123
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:52,056
the United States in the late 18th
century and early 19th century,

124
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:55,416
the concept is rife with problems for
the people actually working there.

125
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:59,016
Workers were subject to poor living
conditions, and the rent for these living

126
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:02,536
spaces would be higher than rent in
surrounding areas.

127
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:06,616
As company towns were fairly isolated,
workers who might have undertaken long

128
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:12,696
distance migration to reach these towns didn't have
many options for making an equivalent wage elsewhere.

129
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:16,616
This bind gave workers little choice but
to essentially give back a portion of

130
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:21,255
their wages to the company in exchange
for lodging, goods and services

131
00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:25,896
If this setup sounds deeply exploitative--
that's because it is.

132
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:29,976
And if workers deigned to organize and
strike in response to these unfair

133
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,576
conditions, the consequences would be
disastrous.

134
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:38,776
The Ludlow Massacre of 1914 demonstrated
this morbidly well, in which the Colorado

135
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:42,776
Fuel and Iron Company, owned by the
Rockefeller Family, brought in the

136
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:47,176
Colorado National Guard and its own
gunman to attack a camp of striking

137
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:50,696
miners from the United Mine Workers of
America.

138
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:55,976
This led to over a dozen miners, their
spouses, and their children being murdered.

139
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:00,776
We can interpret Remake's Midgar as the
highest stage of the company town.

140
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:04,536
It's a settlement that's effectively
owned by the Shinra Company, it's fairly

141
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:07,896
isolated from its closest neighboring
settlement, Kalm,

142
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:13,096
and the existence of the city cannot be
decoupled from its mako reactors.

143
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:16,696
There's a core of people who live in
Midgar so they can work on and maintain

144
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:21,976
those reactors, and everything else--
the police force, the housing, the

145
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:29,255
infrastructure, and even businesses like Sam's Delivery
Service either directly or indirectly serve that core.

146
00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:33,656
The natural resources and wealth that
are extracted from the system end up

147
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:38,296
literally flowing upwards to the Shinra
Company HQ.

148
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:42,616
Boy, I sure am glad we're nearly a
century out from the era of towns like

149
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:47,416
Ludlow and, Final Fantasy VII is a work
of fiction.

150
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:51,176
Foxconn plant: Dismal working Conditions
that fanned a stir. "In a room where

151
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:56,935
more than five people can't sleep, fifteen of us
sleep together on the floor. We stick to one another."

152
00:10:56,959 --> 00:11:06,296
"The worker who did not want to be identified said
she earned ₹11,500 per month per month and paid ₹130

153
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:10,456
per month for the hostel and food." "Several others
and I have had stomach pains and urinary tract

154
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:14,616
infections before." "They serve us food on
time but very little.

155
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:19,016
Some women stay hungry throughout the day."
Amazon Is Creating Company Towns Across the

156
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:22,856
United States. "These are entire families
employed by Amazon.

157
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:28,136
Many of them will be let go within weeks,
though many others will quit even sooner,

158
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:32,456
unable to endure the stress and strain of the
job." "A public high-school classroom designed to

159
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:37,255
resemble an Amazon facility with
students wearing Amazon logos on their

160
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:42,055
clothing as they memorize Amazon's
leadership principles."

161
00:11:42,079 --> 00:11:44,055
Ahem. 2. Paramilitaries.

162
00:11:44,079 --> 00:11:48,375
Multinationals have long been accused of
funding paramilitaries to brutally

163
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:52,296
enforce their profit-driven goals in
regions around the world.

164
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:56,776
Take the humble Chiquita banana. For
nearly a century, the past and present

165
00:11:56,800 --> 00:12:01,736
incarnations of Chiquita brands
International have allegedly worked with

166
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:07,255
paramilitaries in Colombia to murder
union organizers, indigenous Mayan people

167
00:12:07,279 --> 00:12:11,336
and other activists.
We can look further back at the British

168
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:16,296
East India Company, what we might consider
the world's first multinational corporation.

169
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:23,336
The company's activities led to the subjugation of the
region of Bengal in South Asia in the mid-18th century.

170
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:30,375
Bengal was then used as a staging ground for the conquest
of the rest of the subcontinent over the next century.

171
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:34,536
The looting of South Asia, the seizure of
its property and wealth, was executed by the

172
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:39,096
use of a private army trained and paid
by the Company.

173
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:43,495
The Shinra Company evokes this paradigm
of colonialism in their use of SOLDIER

174
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:47,736
to intervene in places like Wutai. Before
the events of Remake, the Shinra Company

175
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:51,336
planned to establish a mako reactor in
the nation of Wutai.

176
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:56,536
This understandably set off alarm bells
with the Wutains because... why wouldn't it?

177
00:12:56,560 --> 00:13:01,495
But more specifically, the Wutains had
seen the way mako reactors were used to

178
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:05,096
consolidate the Shinra Company's
economic and political control over a

179
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:12,296
region. This initial resistance, of course, escalated
into a war between Wutai and the Shinra Company.

180
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:17,576
Now, as an aside if we go through records
of the Shinra Company colonizers--yes, I

181
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:22,136
said it, colonizers who participated in
the Wutai campaign,

182
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:24,536
there's the villainous Sephiroth of
course,

183
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:27,656
but look a little closer and who else do
you see?

184
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:32,615
Why, it's the fandom's favorite boy Zach
Fair. I'm sorry to break it to you all,

185
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:36,456
but your fave is a war criminal.

186
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:39,175
3. Corporations and Government.

187
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:43,336
Now, a lot of the real life history that
I've spoken about so far was facilitated

188
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:46,456
with the consent of most of the
governments involved.

189
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:50,216
In Ludlow, the Rockefellers leveraged
their influence to get the Governor of

190
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:56,296
Colorado to mobilize the Colorado National
Guard to kill miners and their families.

191
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:59,896
In Colombia, Chiquita's alleged
collaboration with right-wing death

192
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:05,016
squads was often condoned by whichever
government was in power at the time.

193
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:09,416
The British East India Company counted
numerous supporters and shareholders

194
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:16,536
among members of parliament and waged its bloody
campaign in South Asia with the permission of the crown.

195
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:20,216
There are probably countless examples I
can add to this section like the issue

196
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:25,656
of think tanks and lobbyists advancing
corporate interests in the United States.

197
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:30,136
Did you know that some go as far as to
write model legislation that can be

198
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:34,536
copied and submitted by lawmakers with
some edits?

199
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:38,136
Or the age-old tradition of governments
around the world selling national

200
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:42,136
institutions and natural resources to
corporate interests?

201
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:46,935
Just look at the privatization of
Chile's education, healthcare, social

202
00:14:46,959 --> 00:14:53,175
security, and copper mines during the brutally
repressive Pinochet regime in the 80s.

203
00:14:53,199 --> 00:14:57,175
When we bring this back to Final Fantasy
VII, we see the broad theme of corporate

204
00:14:57,199 --> 00:15:02,935
power outstripping government power in the
Shinra Company's relationship with Mayor Domino.

205
00:15:02,959 --> 00:15:06,696
His office is placed in an obscure part
of the Shinra Company headquarters, and

206
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:10,935
his actual governing responsibilities
are very minimal, save for issuing a

207
00:15:10,959 --> 00:15:14,696
temporary state of emergency towards the
beginning of the game.

208
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:23,175
"The mayor is the best," more like
"capitalism is the worst," am I right folks?

209
00:15:23,199 --> 00:15:27,416
It's easy to dismiss these parallels and
consider the way Midgar and Shinra are

210
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:31,096
conveyed in final fantasy vii as purely
aesthetic.

211
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:35,336
You can say the megacity, the futuristic
tech, and Chadley the intern are just

212
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:41,175
there to evoke cyberpunk coolness, and there's no
intentional engagement with left-wing politics.

213
00:15:41,199 --> 00:15:44,216
But i think it's clear that the writers
of the original game and Remake,

214
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:50,136
Kazushige Nojima and company, were explicitly
engaging with anti-capitalist themes.

215
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:51,255
And why?

216
00:15:51,279 --> 00:15:55,576
If the historical parallels alone aren't
enough, what tips the scale?

217
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:59,576
The answer lies in the ideological
opposition to the Shinra Company, the

218
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:03,735
political counter-power named after an
environmental phenomenon,

219
00:16:03,759 --> 00:16:07,016
Avalanche.

220
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:12,696
Chapter 2: A Framework for Avalanche

221
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:14,856
Barret: "Okay then.

222
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:20,536
Let's talk about wasteful indulgences.
What is mako? The lifestream!

223
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:26,456
the lifeblood of the planet--our planet!
But Shinra keeps on slurping it up like

224
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:30,776
a thirsty dog! Whadda you think's gonna
happen if you don't stop, huh!?"

225
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:35,016
Frameworks are an important part of any
serious critical analysis, whether it's of a TV

226
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:39,016
show, a video game, or even events
happening in the world.

227
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:43,576
For the purpose of this video, let's define
a "framework," also known as a "lens,"

228
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:50,536
or a "frame of reference," or a "perspective" as the
analytical approach we take when we interpret a subject.

229
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:56,935
This analytical approach can be informed by a school
of thought, historical patterns, or other ideas.

230
00:16:56,959 --> 00:17:00,776
For example, my discussion of Final
Fantasy VII so far has employed a

231
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:07,336
framework that's attuned to social and economic
inequalities and their relationship to capitalism.

232
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:10,856
We'll call this framework
"anti-capitalism."

233
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:15,096
Now, in reading through Remake's script, I
thought Barret's "wasteful indulgences"

234
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:20,055
speech to President Shinra and the people
of Midgar was probably the most complete

235
00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:23,576
expression of Avalanche's goals in the
base game.

236
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:27,576
A planet is a living organism, the Shinra
Company is extracting the planet's

237
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:33,015
lifeblood, and severe consequences lie ahead
for the planet if that process isn't stopped.

238
00:17:33,039 --> 00:17:36,856
This is why Avalanche must stop the
Shinra Company.

239
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:43,496
So we can consider the framework of Barret's analysis as
one that's broadly "environmental" - a perspective concerned

240
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:48,456
with the welfare of the planet. But let's
put a pin in that speech for a second.

241
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:52,056
There are a number of real-life
left-wing resistance groups which can be

242
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:59,576
cited as analogues to Avalanche, ranging from Weather
Underground of the United States to the Naxalites in India.

243
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:03,256
Without getting too far into the weeds
of perfect comparisons, I'd like to look

244
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:08,136
at an organization that is ostensibly
different from Avalanche in most ways,

245
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:11,576
save for their concern around
environmental destruction.

246
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:17,096
Let's talk about Extinction Rebellion UK,
or XR UK for short.

247
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:22,936
XR UK was established in October 2018 to
combat the ongoing climate emergency. The

248
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:26,696
group uses a strategy of non-violent
civil disobedience, which includes

249
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:31,416
tactics such as occupying public spaces,
blocking roads and bridges, and having

250
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:35,816
its members be arrested en masse to
overwhelm court systems.

251
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:42,376
Generally, the goal of XR UK demonstrations is to compel
governments to urgently act against climate change.

252
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:45,816
This can be done through citizen
cssemblies, or bodies of citizens

253
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:51,015
advising governments on environmental
policy. What hangs over all this is

254
00:18:51,039 --> 00:18:54,856
XR UK's long-standing demand to "Go Beyond
Politics."

255
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:59,096
In an article for Current Affairs
journalist Erica X Eisen writes that

256
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:03,736
while the slogan is linked to XR's
demand to create citizens' assemblies,

257
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:10,296
it's also worded that way to draw in a large amount of
supporters, even those who may consider themselves apolitical.

258
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:14,456
Eisen states that "Go Beyond Politics"
pivots too far away from a framework

259
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:17,816
that might explain what's driving the
climate emergency.

260
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:22,216
Eisen and i view the climate emergency
through an anti-capitalist lens.

261
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:26,535
We see the primary demand of capitalism.
endless growth. as fundamentally

262
00:19:26,559 --> 00:19:30,296
incompatible with the finite resources
of our planet.

263
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:34,696
So when i read Barret's "wasteful
indulgences" speech, I'm reminded of

264
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:39,816
XR UK's "Go Beyond Politics" slogan--they
both have environmental concerns at the

265
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:45,176
forefront, but the framework is missing that
little extra bit to tie it all together.

266
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:50,456
It's missing a link to the root cause of
all this: capitalism.

267
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:54,456
Speaking of, let's take that pin out of
Barret's speech now and test the

268
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:58,456
limitations of Avalanche's environmental
perspective.

269
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:02,696
Let's try a thought experiment: we start
by asking ourselves, would Barret's

270
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:07,736
concerns be sufficiently addressed if
mako reactors were replaced with... oh,

271
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:10,056
I don't know, *oil wells?*

272
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:13,816
Would it be too out of line to imagine a
post-Shinra world, where Barret, having

273
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:18,376
succeeded in the elimination of mako
reactors, is totally fine with burning

274
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:24,775
oil for energy? A post-Shinra world where
Barrett has a puffer vest and a fishnet shirt?

275
00:20:24,799 --> 00:20:27,336
Do we know enough about Barret's
perspective in Remake to make an

276
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:35,976
argument for or against oil fields and fishnet
shirts!? Ahem. To be fair to XR UK, the

277
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:40,696
organization as a whole is intentionally
decentralized so not everyone has to

278
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:43,976
agree with "Go Beyond Politics" to
participate.

279
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:49,015
And while "Go Beyond Politics" has had a
presence in XR UK's branding, there are

280
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:55,015
rank-and-file members who do participate in the
organization with an anti-capitalist framework.

281
00:20:55,039 --> 00:20:59,976
And to be fair to Remake, Barret does
comment on a Shinra employee being blind

282
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:04,216
to his "corporate masters profiting from
the planet's pain."

283
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:08,535
in a scene that both adds a smidge of
depth to Avalanche's politics in the base

284
00:21:08,559 --> 00:21:11,895
game, and is a great character moment for
Barret.

285
00:21:11,919 --> 00:21:17,015
Additionally, a member of Avalanche calls
the Shinra Company fascists during a

286
00:21:17,039 --> 00:21:22,775
shootout at the Sector 7 Pillar, which
you know, *I* won't argue with.

287
00:21:22,799 --> 00:21:27,096
With all that said, I think it's useful
for us to go back to the original game.

288
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:29,096
Let's take a look

289
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:32,616
Barret: "You saw that village.
It's always the powerless that get

290
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:37,015
victimized by tyrants like Shinra.
The one's with the power control those

291
00:21:37,039 --> 00:21:40,216
without it. It's just the way of the
world now.

292
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:45,015
I can't let 'em do that. That's why I
formed AVALANCHE to fight them."

293
00:21:45,039 --> 00:21:49,015
This dialogue is actually inaccessible
in the original game because of a bug

294
00:21:49,039 --> 00:21:53,655
that prevents it from triggering.
You'd read this dialogue in Gongaga,

295
00:21:53,679 --> 00:22:00,056
a settlement in ruin thanks to the explosion of a mako
reactor a little while before the events of the game.

296
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:03,816
It's a shame that this dialogue is lost
to a lot of players, because it better

297
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:09,015
establishes Barret's perspective, and by
extension, Avalanche's perspective.

298
00:22:09,039 --> 00:22:13,416
They're not just people who want to
preserve the Lifestream, but they see a

299
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:17,176
throughline between the Shinra
Company's extraction of mako and the

300
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:20,936
Shinra Company's oppression of people
around the world.

301
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:24,856
The InterMISSION chapters take the
spirit of this bit of dialogue,

302
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:28,616
marries it to that smidge of depth from
Barret's remake dialogue that I

303
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:31,895
mentioned earlier, and gives us the
following:

304
00:22:31,919 --> 00:22:36,456
Sonon: "Before you got here, I did a little
bit of recon. Found out what they want.

305
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:44,456
Free elections, workers'
rights, fair distribution of wealth...

306
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:47,096
... Amazing.

307
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:49,416
"Are those my glasses?"

308
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:51,576
Um... No?

309
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:58,616
But seriously, the dialogue is so explicitly
coded as "leftist" that it's almost in-your-face.

310
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:03,256
Just as a brief example, the twin demands
of "workers rights" and "fair distribution

311
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:06,696
of wealth" come up a lot in
Marxist thought.

312
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:10,936
This school of thought describes the
relationship of "workers"--individuals who

313
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:15,336
sell their labor to the "ruling class"--
individuals who own the means that

314
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:20,296
workers use to perform their labor.
Marxism views this relationship as an

315
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:24,216
unequal arrangement that sees one side
accumulating just enough to continue

316
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:29,256
living, while the other side hoards and
defends wealth that they didn't create.

317
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:35,816
The way to upend this relationship is by organizing workers
against the ruling class, which leads to victories like

318
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:42,296
better working conditions, the redistribution of wealth
from the top to the bottom, and ultimately the end of the

319
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:46,616
system that relies on this awful
relationship in the first place.

320
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:51,336
And before you say anything, no, I don't
think i'd call this game "Marxist." I'll go

321
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:54,616
into this at length a little later in
the video, but there are a few small

322
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:58,535
issues that prevent me from canonizing
Final Fantasy VII in the cultural

323
00:23:58,559 --> 00:24:05,096
Marxism canon alongside classic works of
art like the Battle of Algiers and...

324
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:10,135
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince?

325
00:24:10,159 --> 00:24:11,255
... Whoa...

326
00:24:11,279 --> 00:24:14,616
Apparently, in the extended cut of the
film, the waitress from the introduction

327
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:20,216
stares directly at the camera and implores
the viewer to support union drives.

328
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:25,976
Harry Potter and the Waitress at Treats
is now my prevailing headcanon and OTP,

329
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:31,096
and I think it would make a fine AO3
title, and I hope somebody will get on that

330
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:36,056
and give us the ending to the series
that we all deserve.

331
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:36,936
Um...

332
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:38,936
Moving on...

333
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:42,616
If we take Barret's dialogue in Remake
alone, there is some plausible

334
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:47,096
deniability against radical left politics
and the game's depiction of Avalanche.

335
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:53,176
You might argue "Avalanche is beyond politics, they
just blame the Shinra Company for hurting the planet."

336
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:56,696
But the context we're given in the
original, InterMISSION and the world we

337
00:24:56,720 --> 00:25:02,456
inhabit very concretely place Avalanche's goals
and actions in an anti-capitalist framework.

338
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:07,816
To quote Barret in 2022: multinational
corporations are still [quote] destroying

339
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:13,416
our planet just to build their power and
line their own damn pockets with gold.

340
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:17,816
[end quote]

341
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:23,816
Chapter 3: Radical Hearts, Radical Mirrors

342
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:25,655
We began with this question:

343
00:25:25,679 --> 00:25:29,176
"Is Final Fantasy VII a radical left-wing
game?"

344
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:32,535
To answer this question I made two
assertions.

345
00:25:32,559 --> 00:25:36,535
First, there is a radical heart to
Final Fantasy VII.

346
00:25:36,559 --> 00:25:42,296
Second, Final Fantasy VII reflects
real-world radical left politics. I think

347
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:46,535
the *radical heart* of Final Fantasy VII
Is made manifest in the relationships

348
00:25:46,559 --> 00:25:50,216
between Avalanche, Midgar and the Shinra
Company.

349
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:55,336
Those relationships convey in-universe
ideologies that read to us as radical

350
00:25:55,360 --> 00:26:01,496
because they *reflect* certain historical patterns,
political theory, and the state of the world today.

351
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:04,296
Let's go over what we've discussed so
far.

352
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:08,696
1. Avalanche is an organization of
radical environmentalists who interpret

353
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:12,696
the actions of their enemy through an
anti-capitalist lens.

354
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:16,696
2. The enemy that avalanche fights
against, the enemy that destroys the

355
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:21,416
environment and oppresses people around
the world, is the Shinra Company.

356
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:25,576
3. The monument to Shinra's Global
campaign of environmental destruction

357
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:30,296
and domination of its inhabitants, the
place that puts the "under" in "underclass,"

358
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:35,096
the expired pizza that rots the land--
is the city of Midgar.

359
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:39,496
This ever beating heart propels much of
what happens in Remake proper.

360
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:43,096
We know that the shinra company's
process of accumulating wealth has had

361
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:48,856
tremendous consequences like war, murder,
kidnapping, massacres, environmental

362
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:53,655
destruction, and economic inequality.
We know that these consequences brought

363
00:26:53,679 --> 00:27:00,216
Cloud, Barret, Tifa Aerith and Red XIII to
Midgar at different points of their lives.

364
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:04,216
We know that after arriving in Midgar,
the lives of these characters converge

365
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:09,416
in part because of additional shinra
company fuckery during the events of Remake.

366
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:14,135
But is that the end of this video?
Well, if we want to absolutely,

367
00:27:14,159 --> 00:27:18,135
definitively, and concretely conclude
that Remake has the promise of radical

368
00:27:18,159 --> 00:27:23,576
left politics, it behooves us to see
where Remake falls short of that promise.

369
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:31,416
Let's look at two examples, starting with
a closer examination of Barret Wallace.

370
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:36,456
Chapter 4: The Trouble with
Barret Wallace

371
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:39,655
What does it mean that most of the
radical Barret quotes I cited in the

372
00:27:39,679 --> 00:27:44,216
last chapter came from the original game?
When you look at the equivalent sections

373
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:48,216
in Remake's script--the sections in which
you'd expect Barret to make the same

374
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:55,496
indictments of inequality except in 60 frames per
second with full voice-acting-- they're not there.

375
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:59,655
Consider the train ride after the
bombing of Reactor Number 1.

376
00:27:59,679 --> 00:28:06,296
In the original game, that's where the "fucking
'pizza'" conversation happens between Barret and Cloud.

377
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:13,096
We're specifically told that lack of money and
love of the land keep the poor on the lower plate.

378
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:17,816
In Remake this conversation shifts much
of the focus to the mako reactor's...

379
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:20,535
adverse effects on soil and air.

380
00:28:20,559 --> 00:28:24,775
Consider also the aftermath of the
Sector 7 plate fall.

381
00:28:24,799 --> 00:28:29,015
In the original game, Tifa wonders aloud
if Shinra razed the Sector and

382
00:28:29,039 --> 00:28:31,976
massacred its people because of
Avalanche.

383
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:36,375
Barret replies that the atrocity is
Shinra's fault and it's "always been

384
00:28:36,399 --> 00:28:40,616
the Shinra" -- they're
destroying the planet for profit.

385
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:45,336
In Remake, Tifa expresses the same
sentiment, and Barret again emphasizes

386
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:48,296
that the massacre is the Shinra
Company's fault...

387
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:51,895
but the more radical line about profit
is excised.

388
00:28:51,919 --> 00:28:55,655
It's like Remakes writers took the
original character's anti-capitalist

389
00:28:55,679 --> 00:29:02,456
framework and replaced it with the less severe
"environmental" framework we discussed earlier.

390
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:07,176
Or, to use a more relatable analogy for
today's generation, the proletarian

391
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:13,736
Barret of the original game has been
replaced by the renegade Barret in Remake.

392
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:14,696
... get it?

393
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:16,135
like the, uh,

394
00:29:16,159 --> 00:29:21,096
like the 1918 polemic that Vladimir
Lenin wrote against Karl Kautsky?

395
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:22,535
Um...

396
00:29:22,559 --> 00:29:27,336
make sure you like and subscribe for
more topical political content.

397
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:31,096
When we consider the way Remake reins
in Barret's anti-capitalist rhetoric,

398
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:35,336
and the way the game focuses more on
Avalanche's "collateral damage" in the form

399
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:40,616
of Midgar residents being harmed and property
being destroyed compared to the original game,

400
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:44,135
we should keep in mind that this
political shift was done deliberately.

401
00:29:44,159 --> 00:29:49,336
Here's what Remake's Director Motomu
Toriyama had to say in an interview:

402
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:53,255
"... when the original came out we were all
pretty young and things like 'is it

403
00:29:53,279 --> 00:29:56,936
really right to destroy the mako
reactors to save the planet?' didn't

404
00:29:56,960 --> 00:30:00,856
really cross our minds at all. However,
with the remake a lot of things have

405
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:05,176
happened in the real world, so we as the
developers have a responsibility to

406
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:10,296
figure out how to make things relate as
well as how far to go."

407
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:13,416
As a result of this shift,
Remake Barret's strongest indictment of the

408
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:18,135
Shinra Company's accumulation of wealth--
their "profiting from the planet's pain"--

409
00:30:18,159 --> 00:30:23,416
is in a single line in a missable cutscene
in the Shinra Company Headquarters.

410
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:27,655
We also see a notable divergence from
the original game's plot and Remake

411
00:30:27,679 --> 00:30:31,015
the version of Avalanche that we see at
the start of the game is no longer a

412
00:30:31,039 --> 00:30:37,736
group that Barret founded, it's now a much larger
organization comprised of a headquarters and multiple cells.

413
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:42,375
Avalanche HQ considers Barret's cell
too extreme, and by the start of the game,

414
00:30:42,399 --> 00:30:48,375
his group operates as a splinter cell detached
from the larger Avalanche organization.

415
00:30:48,399 --> 00:30:52,535
I'm tentatively watching to see how this
plot update plays out in future

416
00:30:52,559 --> 00:30:56,296
installments, but in the context of
Remake and InterMISSION

417
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:59,816
I think it's not the greatest attempt at
adding nuance.

418
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:03,976
My bone to pick with this plot thread is
political: we never see what the more

419
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:10,296
"moderate" strategy of addressing the Shinra Company's
runaway oppression and environmental destruction looks like.

420
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:14,056
Moreover, the final word on the
ideological conflict between the more

421
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:20,135
extreme and moderate sides of Avalanche
is given to us by Sonon in InterMISSION.

422
00:31:20,159 --> 00:31:22,296
Sonon: "Hey, about what you said earlier."

423
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:23,176
Yuffie: "Which was...?"

424
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:26,375
Sonon: "About Avalanche--how it's changed." Yuffie: "Oh. That."

425
00:31:26,399 --> 00:31:30,535
Sonon: "These people are too
soft. But those splinter cell guys?

426
00:31:30,559 --> 00:31:34,535
*They* sound like the ones we should have
teamed up with. Don'tcha think?"

427
00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:37,736
For what it's worth Sonon... I think so.

428
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:41,176
One other area that could have actually
used more nuance in the final product

429
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:45,416
was Barret's blaxploitation-inspired...
everything.

430
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:48,616
That's, right I couldn't make a video
about the radical politics of Final

431
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:52,116
Fantasy VII without addressing the
elephant in the room:

432
00:31:52,140 --> 00:31:56,696
Barret: "Duhn-duhn-duhn-*duhn*, duhn duhn, *duhn*-da-*duhn*!" "Suck on this!"

433
00:31:56,720 --> 00:32:02,696
"Where could they be going...?
Embarking on an adventure to find some

434
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:07,895
treasure!?" "Suck on this!" "This pump's
sole purpose is to drain the planet dry.

435
00:32:07,919 --> 00:32:12,936
While you sleep, while you eat, while you
shit--it's here, sucking up mako.

436
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:19,895
It doesn't rest and it doesn't care!
You do realize what mako is, don't you?

437
00:32:19,919 --> 00:32:26,456
Mako is the lifeblood of our world. The
planet bleeds green like you and me bleed red.

438
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:32,135
The hell you think's gonna happen when
it's all gone, huh!? Answer me!

439
00:32:32,159 --> 00:32:35,976
You gonna stand there and pretend you
can't hear the planet crying out in

440
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:42,936
pain?" "Open wide!

441
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:50,696
And suck on this!"

442
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:56,775
Black representation in mainstream media
has traditionally had a lot of problems.

443
00:32:56,799 --> 00:32:59,655
How do i define the scope of mainstream
media--

444
00:32:59,679 --> 00:33:05,255
Is a game from Japan really a part of
mainstream media in the English-speaking world?

445
00:33:05,279 --> 00:33:09,655
Well, I live in the United States, and
within the past 10 or more years, our

446
00:33:09,679 --> 00:33:15,576
national conversations around literature,
movies, television shows, and video games

447
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:19,176
have included work from other places
around the world.

448
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:23,816
This isn't the result of happenstance,
but intentional.

449
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:29,176
For example, the 2021 anti-capitalist
sensation Squid Game didn't cross over

450
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:33,895
from people living in South Korea to a
U.S. audience by word-of-mouth,

451
00:33:33,919 --> 00:33:41,255
but according to creator Hwang Dong-hyuk, it was
intentionally written and marketed for a global audience.

452
00:33:41,279 --> 00:33:45,096
How do i define the problems of black
representation in media?

453
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:49,495
The typical tropes have been well
described for over a century by scholars,

454
00:33:49,519 --> 00:33:55,096
by journalists, by activists... by regular
folks who consume art. There's enough

455
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:58,856
writing on the history and problems of
black representation and media to fill

456
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:03,736
up several Hell Houses, but I liked the
CBC's brief exploration of black

457
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:07,495
representation in Hollywood films if you
want to dip your toes.

458
00:34:07,519 --> 00:34:12,615
Feel free to recommend readings in the
comments as well, for me and other viewers.

459
00:34:12,639 --> 00:34:16,296
The issues with Remake's most prominent
instance of black representation have

460
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:23,335
been outlined by writers such as Jeffrey Rousseau
in Ars Technica, and Norris Howard in Checkpoint XP.

461
00:34:23,359 --> 00:34:27,815
These issues go as far as the way
Barret's hair is rendered, as clarified

462
00:34:27,839 --> 00:34:32,855
in an illuminating conversation led by
Austin Walker on Twitter.

463
00:34:32,879 --> 00:34:37,416
In short, Remake's Barret exhibits
exaggerated, relatively more emotive

464
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:41,016
speech that evokes a preacher from the
U.S. South.

465
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:45,496
He channels the trope of the big scary
black man at points.

466
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:50,135
He also functions as comic relief by
doing things like singing Stamp the

467
00:34:50,159 --> 00:34:53,976
dog's theme song
and the game's victory fanfare.

468
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:57,976
Prior to Remake, Barret already carried
some baggage because of the way fans

469
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:02,616
associated him with Mr. T
from the popular 80s U.S. television

470
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:07,656
series A-Team. This association has been
acknowledged by Final Fantasy VII

471
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:12,936
character designer and writer Tetsuya
Nomura who wrote in 2006: "Barret is

472
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:16,696
often compared to a certain 'A-Team'
member."

473
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:21,896
Interesting to note is that Barret's
Mr.T-esque dialogue quirks in the original--

474
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:25,256
for example his tendency to call people
"fools"--

475
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:29,416
appears to be a consequence of the
English language localization.

476
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:33,896
In playing the original in both English
and Japanese at the same time writer

477
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:41,256
Tim Rogers in Kotaku describes Barret coming off as
more of a serious military man in the original Japanese.

478
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:45,575
For all of Remake Barret's good scenes
and dialogue, the Remake team did a

479
00:35:45,599 --> 00:35:49,016
pretty poor job at shaking off this
baggage.

480
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:54,216
While he isn't emulating Mr. T anymore, as
Jeffrey Rousseau points out, his voice

481
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:59,095
still oozes black exploitation
characters of the 70s. I've seen attempts

482
00:35:59,119 --> 00:36:04,296
by commenters to downplay the issue in one of
the referenced articles and the Twitter thread.

483
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:08,376
The issue is hand waved as "Japanese
developers are making a product for

484
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:12,936
Japanese people first and foremost, they
can't be faulted for messing up Barret,"

485
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:17,335
"Japanese media has a poor track record
in terms of the depiction of

486
00:36:17,359 --> 00:36:21,416
non-Japanese ethnicity," "The concerns
about good representation of black

487
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:27,095
people is a U.S. conceit that's out of touch
with the rest of the world," and so on.

488
00:36:27,119 --> 00:36:30,536
But we're not talking about sheltered
babies who happened to put together a

489
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:33,575
video game that became an international
hit.

490
00:36:33,599 --> 00:36:38,136
This is a corporation that, despite being
at least peripherally aware of negative

491
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:46,776
associations around Barret, still made a deliberate
decision to convey a black character in a stereotypical way.

492
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:52,536
As Austin Walker writes: "You cannot give
Barret a blaxploitation voice, make him

493
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:58,536
speak with black slang and then pretend
that you don't owe anything to blackness."

494
00:36:58,560 --> 00:37:01,736
Remake's failure to better engage with
the blackness it borrows from

495
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:06,296
unfortunately fits the same pattern of
failure in mainstream media.

496
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:10,376
There's one last facet of Remake Barret
that I'll talk about, and it lies at the

497
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:13,575
intersection of two dimensions we've
already talked about.

498
00:37:13,599 --> 00:37:18,296
Let's look at a passage from political
scientist Cedric Robinson's 1998 essay

499
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:22,936
"Black Exploitation and the
Misrepresentation of Liberation."

500
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:27,736
Unfortunately this is the only work in
this video that's paywalled: the essay is

501
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:32,055
available in the collection Cedric J.
Robinson: On Racial Capitalism, Black

502
00:37:32,079 --> 00:37:37,416
Internationalism, and Cultures of
Resistance. If you have access to

503
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:44,456
academic search engines, *any* academic search engines,
you can find the original article by plugging in the title.

504
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:49,815
I've transcribed the passage most
relevant to this discussion in full:

505
00:37:49,839 --> 00:37:53,815
One of the most effective and clever
manoeuvres of the Blaxploitation genre

506
00:37:53,839 --> 00:37:58,856
was the appropriation and representation
of Angela Davis's public image.

507
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:02,456
This manipulation, of course, was of a
piece with the commercial cinema's

508
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:08,536
translation of the mass black rebellion which
occurred near the end of the Civil Rights era...

509
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:12,216
independent and then established
film-makers trivialised the troubled

510
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:16,815
activists of the movement into the now
familiar male counter-revolutionary

511
00:38:16,839 --> 00:38:22,776
creatures: the male prostitute ('Sweetback');
the vigilante cops ('Gravedigger Jones' and

512
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:30,376
'Coffin Ed Johnson'); the dope pusher ('Shaft');
and the gangster ('Black Caesar', etc.)

513
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:35,335
... Film however transported Davis's form
from a representation of a revolutionist to

514
00:38:35,359 --> 00:38:39,335
that of an erotic black nationalist,
largely devoid of historical

515
00:38:39,359 --> 00:38:45,496
consciousness. This was achieved by eviscerating the
original's intellectual sophistication, political and

516
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:50,055
organisational context, doctrinal
commitments, and most tellingly, her

517
00:38:50,079 --> 00:38:56,936
critique of capitalist society and its
employment of gender, race and class."

518
00:38:56,960 --> 00:39:03,416
Robinson goes on to specifically describe the eroticization
of Angela Davis in blaxploitation films through

519
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:07,335
characters played by Pam Grier and
Rosalind Cash--

520
00:39:07,359 --> 00:39:10,776
but what we're concerned about when it
comes to Barret is the idea of black

521
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:15,176
militants having their own image and
their own systemic critiques caricatured

522
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:19,095
when they're translated from real life
to film.

523
00:39:19,119 --> 00:39:22,696
When I look at Barret and all of his
incarnations, original, Remake or

524
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:27,176
otherwise, it's hard not to see
Robinson's observations being practiced

525
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:31,736
even if the underlying context and
authorial intentions aren't 100% aligned

526
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:34,776
with blaxploitation filmmakers of the
70s,

527
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:37,976
I think there's a throughline between
the archetypical images of black

528
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:42,936
militants in the United States from the
60s and 70s and Barret.

529
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:46,936
For the sake of my argument let's place
the start of this throughline at the

530
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:50,376
real-life black radicals of the 60s and
70s.

531
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:54,536
those real-life people are transformed
into political caricatures in the

532
00:39:54,560 --> 00:40:00,696
blaxploitation films of the 70s and 80s.
One soon-to-be famous actor named Mr. T

533
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:05,335
makes his Hollywood debut in the
blaxploitation film Penitentiary II in

534
00:40:05,359 --> 00:40:13,896
1982 before becoming a breakout star with his role
as Clubber Lang in Rocky III later that same year.

535
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:17,815
Mr. T goes on to achieve lasting
international recognition with the

536
00:40:17,839 --> 00:40:24,616
starring role on A-Team as B.A. Baracas
from 1983 to 1987.

537
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:29,976
The original Final Fantasy VII is released
in 1997, about a decade after the end of

538
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:33,896
A-Team, and one of the first party
members you meet in the game, one of the

539
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:38,696
first party members conceived for the
game, is Barret Wallace. Here, we have a

540
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:45,016
character who evokes Mr. T visually, channels Mr. T
and blaxploitation characters in his dialogue,

541
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:52,055
and has some of the anti-capitalist politics of
those real-life black radicals from the 60s and 70s.

542
00:40:52,079 --> 00:40:56,136
I presented this timeline in a linear
way, but the argument is not intended to

543
00:40:56,160 --> 00:41:01,736
be a straight trip from "point A" to "point
B" -- it's more of a confluence of factors,

544
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:05,815
some connected, like black radicals and
their blaxploitation counterparts, and

545
00:41:05,839 --> 00:41:10,456
some parallel, like the inauguration of
Mr. T into the popular consciousness.

546
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:15,176
But I do see Barrett Wallace as a result
of this confluence.

547
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:20,216
From 1997, let's skip straight to 2021,
where the somewhat de-politicized

548
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:25,656
Barret of the original game has become the
even more depoliticized Barret of Remake.

549
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:30,055
And remember this depoliticization is
relative to his real-life radical

550
00:41:30,079 --> 00:41:34,696
progenitors, not a total judgment of the
two Barrets' politics.

551
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:38,776
This contrast really helps bring into
high relief the idea, partly informed by

552
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:43,416
Dr. Robinson, that the act of translating
revolutionary politics to mainstream

553
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:49,256
media causes those politics to be watered
down or caricatured in the final product.

554
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:53,815
I guess there's one outstanding question
that i've been eliding this whole time:

555
00:41:53,839 --> 00:41:59,896
"Is Barret's portrayal in Final Fantasy
VII Remake racist?"

556
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:03,416
*Yes*

557
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:07,896
Chapter 5: People of Midgar

558
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:11,656
I said earlier that there are a few
small issues that prevent me, a person of

559
00:42:11,680 --> 00:42:16,456
authority, from canonizing Final Fantasy
VII as a Marxist game.

560
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:19,095
Let's get the obvious issues out of the
way:

561
00:42:19,119 --> 00:42:24,136
1. Neither Nojima, Nomura, Toriyama,
nor any of the senior production staff

562
00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:28,055
involved in the Compilation of Final
Fantasy VII have ever publicly

563
00:42:28,079 --> 00:42:35,736
communicated an overtly left-wing intent or inspiration
in conveying the world of Final Fantasy VII.

564
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:40,536
As a bit of a leftist myself I often
have to remind myself that sometimes,

565
00:42:40,560 --> 00:42:45,016
popular media can just make radical
points without necessarily being on the

566
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:48,456
side of international communist
revolution.

567
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:52,456
Like, it's definitely okay for John
Oliver to point out contradictions in

568
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:58,936
capitalism in his weekly show without taking that
extra half-step and indicting the whole damn system.

569
00:42:58,960 --> 00:43:03,416
It's okay for John Oliver to present
issues in such a way that the viewer is

570
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:08,936
guided towards interrogating the system that
created those issues--the system being capitalism--

571
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:13,656
without John Oliver himself actually
condemning capitalism.

572
00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:18,696
It's OK for John Oliver to not be
communist, okay?

573
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:25,095
2. The original's overt anti-capitalist themes
fall off a bit after the Midgar section.

574
00:43:25,119 --> 00:43:29,496
We'll see how the Remake series handles
these themes in subsequent releases, but

575
00:43:29,520 --> 00:43:36,136
from what I remember of the original, the game's
themes pivot to Cloud's past, Aerith's future,

576
00:43:36,160 --> 00:43:44,055
and the pursuit of Sephiroth, or the Path
of Sephirot if you're a Xenogears fan.

577
00:43:44,079 --> 00:43:46,536
Does that even make sense?

578
00:43:46,560 --> 00:43:49,416
Let me know in the comments, will you?

579
00:43:49,440 --> 00:43:53,016
Shinra largely leaves the foreground for
the next part of the game, with a few

580
00:43:53,040 --> 00:43:58,216
exceptions like the Corel Village plot and
the backstory around the Wutai side-quests.

581
00:43:58,240 --> 00:44:04,376
By far the largest demerit I could levy against the
argument that "Remake is a Marxist game" is this:

582
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:08,616
3. The people of Midgar don't participate
in their own liberation. To begin

583
00:44:08,640 --> 00:44:13,416
unpacking this, I ask you this question:
can you recall any instances of regular

584
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:18,055
ole' residents of Midgar in Final
Fantasy VII organizing themselves?

585
00:44:18,079 --> 00:44:21,176
We don't see people clamoring to join
Avalanche.

586
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:27,095
The most grassroots form of activity we see is
the work of the Neighborhood Watch in Sector 7,

587
00:44:27,119 --> 00:44:31,496
a community defense organization that
patrols and exterminates monsters.

588
00:44:31,520 --> 00:44:35,656
Meanwhile, we're told that Avalanche
levies demands like workers' rights, we

589
00:44:35,680 --> 00:44:38,936
never get more information about
Avalanche's praxis around these

590
00:44:38,960 --> 00:44:45,736
demands, nor information on how Midgar residents
participate in advocating these demands for themselves.

591
00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:49,416
There isn't a great sense that the
residents of Midgar stand in solidarity

592
00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:53,016
with Avalanche, something that's
especially made apparent in the

593
00:44:53,040 --> 00:44:57,656
incidental dialogue from Midgar
residents after the Sector 7 plate fall.

594
00:44:57,680 --> 00:45:02,055
So we conclude that Avalanche is the
primary, if not sole group of people

595
00:45:02,079 --> 00:45:06,776
agitating for radical change in Midgar.
We also conclude that Avalanche and

596
00:45:06,800 --> 00:45:12,376
Midgar residents don't have much cross-pollination
by way of collaboration going on.

597
00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:18,936
This is just not a Marxist relation nor is
it a strong portrayal of radical politics.

598
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:25,176
You'll remember from our discussion of Marxist thought
that workers are named the agents of radical change.

599
00:45:25,200 --> 00:45:28,136
To paraphrase the Communist Manifesto:

600
00:45:28,160 --> 00:45:33,815
"Communists have no interest separate and
apart from those of the workers as a whole...

601
00:45:33,839 --> 00:45:39,176
The immediate aim of the communists is
the formation of the workers into a class,

602
00:45:39,200 --> 00:45:45,335
overthrow of ruling class supremacy and
conquest of political power by workers."

603
00:45:45,359 --> 00:45:50,696
There's no doubt that the Avalanche members we know
intimately are reflective of workers in Midgar, with

604
00:45:50,720 --> 00:45:57,016
Biggs being a former teacher, Jesse being
a former actor, and Tifa being a bartender,

605
00:45:57,040 --> 00:45:59,496
Cloud being a Shinra Public...

606
00:45:59,520 --> 00:46:01,656
SOLDIER First Class.

607
00:46:01,680 --> 00:46:05,896
But all the revolutionary activity that
happens in Midgar begins and ends with

608
00:46:05,920 --> 00:46:12,136
Avalanche. We don't see other Midgar residents
get involved or become radicalized by Avalanche.

609
00:46:12,160 --> 00:46:18,136
Regular ole' Midgar residents don't exhibit any
revolutionary agency towards their own liberation.

610
00:46:18,160 --> 00:46:21,176
There's no self-determination!

611
00:46:21,200 --> 00:46:26,936
I know what you're thinking: "a work doesn't need
to be 'Marxist' to be radical" -- and I agree.

612
00:46:26,960 --> 00:46:30,295
I do think Marxism is a useful lens
through which we can assess a work's

613
00:46:30,319 --> 00:46:35,815
radical qualities, especially given the way
these games evoke anti-capitalist ideas.

614
00:46:35,839 --> 00:46:40,456
Deploying that lens magnifies that last
demerit I described - that the people who

615
00:46:40,480 --> 00:46:44,136
would benefit from their own liberation
are never significantly involved or

616
00:46:44,160 --> 00:46:47,976
represented among the ranks of Avalanche,
who have taken on the mantle of

617
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:52,456
liberator. There is probably some radical
tradition or theory that reconciles this

618
00:46:52,480 --> 00:46:57,656
imbalanced relationship to make it work,
but it's hard for me to co-sign the idea

619
00:46:57,680 --> 00:47:01,335
that a handful of special folks
shepherding the rest of us into a

620
00:47:01,359 --> 00:47:05,496
brighter future is a particularly
radical idea.

621
00:47:05,520 --> 00:47:12,616
With that, I guess it's about time we
answered that one question, isn't it?

622
00:47:12,640 --> 00:47:17,496
Chapter 6:
The Answer

623
00:47:17,520 --> 00:47:21,896
We've reached the end of our journey
together and look how far we've come:

624
00:47:21,920 --> 00:47:26,456
we've vivisected a radical heart, we've
shattered a radical mirror,

625
00:47:26,480 --> 00:47:31,095
we've bullied the man with the machine
gun arm, and most importantly we've saved

626
00:47:31,119 --> 00:47:34,936
an innocent video game from being
labeled "Marxist."

627
00:47:34,960 --> 00:47:39,896
I'm sure you're clamoring to hear a definitive
answer to the question in the title of the video:

628
00:47:39,920 --> 00:47:44,136
"Is Final Fantasy VII a Radical Left-Wing
Game?"

629
00:47:44,160 --> 00:47:50,055
But before we put our stamp on the question once and
for all, I think it's worth noting a couple of things:

630
00:47:50,079 --> 00:47:54,456
First, a handful of you, including my
Developmental Editor Elizabeth

631
00:47:54,480 --> 00:47:58,696
might be annoyed that I spent a lot of
time talking about the "Content" of Final

632
00:47:58,720 --> 00:48:03,496
Fantasy VII without even touching the
"Form" of Final Fantasy VII.

633
00:48:03,520 --> 00:48:06,856
To quote Elizabeth's notes on this video:

634
00:48:06,880 --> 00:48:10,936
"I think part of the analysis of a work
of art's politics is not just its content

635
00:48:10,960 --> 00:48:14,376
[what the game is about, the issues it
deals with, what the plot and characters

636
00:48:14,400 --> 00:48:19,575
show about the politics of the work, etc.]
but its form. For instance, what kind of

637
00:48:19,599 --> 00:48:23,656
narrative it is, how does its genre
influence the story being told, what kind

638
00:48:23,680 --> 00:48:27,976
of interactions does it create with its
audience, what kind of 'subject' interacts

639
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:33,176
with it and interprets it and how;
also who produces it, how it's produced

640
00:48:33,200 --> 00:48:38,295
why societies turn to certain kinds of art
(such as video games) at certain times."

641
00:48:38,319 --> 00:48:43,016
The relationship of "Form" and "Content"
comes out of the writings of G. W. F. Hegel

642
00:48:43,040 --> 00:48:47,176
and Marxist thinkers like Theodor
Adorno, and it's definitely something i

643
00:48:47,200 --> 00:48:50,856
could stand to learn more about.
I'm leaving this as an open thread for

644
00:48:50,880 --> 00:48:56,136
folks to discuss and I might pick it
back up for a new video in the future.

645
00:48:56,160 --> 00:49:01,016
Second, let's be mindful of our tendency
as left-wing consumers and critics to

646
00:49:01,040 --> 00:49:05,575
impute certain political conclusions to
works of art that we enjoy.

647
00:49:05,599 --> 00:49:09,815
Take the statement by English professor
Nicola Nixon:

648
00:49:09,839 --> 00:49:14,055
"The conflation of aesthetic appreciation
and good politics surfaces in certain

649
00:49:14,079 --> 00:49:18,456
critics as a form of leftist wish
fulfillment... in other words, if one likes

650
00:49:18,480 --> 00:49:25,176
the fiction, it must necessarily involve the
articulation of a perceptible, revolutionary project."

651
00:49:25,200 --> 00:49:29,656
Definitely a mood. I often have to stop
myself from running too wild with my

652
00:49:29,680 --> 00:49:32,936
left-wing wish fulfillment when I
brainstorm and write up outlines for my

653
00:49:32,960 --> 00:49:37,656
videos. As a leftist, I think it's fun to
recognize and appreciate radical

654
00:49:37,680 --> 00:49:42,136
left-wing elements in a work, whether
it's anti-capitalist themes, rhetoric

655
00:49:42,160 --> 00:49:47,896
about things like "workers' rights," and
relations that mirror relations we see in history.

656
00:49:47,920 --> 00:49:51,896
I think I would conclude that Final
Fantasy VII doesn't use its radical

657
00:49:51,920 --> 00:49:58,535
left-wing elements as set dressing, but makes those
elements crucial to the existence of its world:

658
00:49:58,559 --> 00:50:03,416
look towards Midgar, the Shinra Company,
and Avalanche as examples.

659
00:50:03,440 --> 00:50:06,216
That said, having reviewed the body of
evidence,

660
00:50:06,240 --> 00:50:14,776
I don't think Final Fantasy VII - the original, Remake Part
1, any iteration - can be called a radical left-wing game.

661
00:50:14,800 --> 00:50:18,136
I don't think there's enough being done
by the game to synthesize its left-wing

662
00:50:18,160 --> 00:50:22,295
elements into a conclusion about the
nature of our world.

663
00:50:22,319 --> 00:50:26,376
The game doesn't have to be an
on-the-nose satire to achieve this,

664
00:50:26,400 --> 00:50:30,936
but it's telling to me that the game's
various anti-capitalist aspects tend to

665
00:50:30,960 --> 00:50:35,976
converge towards the conclusion that
Shinra is the problem and not capitalism

666
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:42,295
generally, limiting the scope of the game's
message to a specific evil inside of its own world.

667
00:50:42,319 --> 00:50:47,335
However, I will say that Final Fantasy
VII is a damn fine game,

668
00:50:47,359 --> 00:50:54,376
leftist gamers don't have to limit themselves to
ideologically pure or even ideologically coherent games,

669
00:50:54,400 --> 00:51:00,055
and you can literally operate a sewer system's
water pump with your girlfriend in Remake.

670
00:51:00,079 --> 00:51:01,335
Play the game.

671
00:51:01,359 --> 00:51:03,095
play InterMISSION.

672
00:51:03,119 --> 00:51:05,016
Just go and do it.

673
00:51:05,040 --> 00:51:10,295
And most importantly, get involved with a
left organization in your area.

674
00:51:10,319 --> 00:51:15,016
If you live in the United States, look up
who's active in your area, see what kind

675
00:51:15,040 --> 00:51:20,295
of work they do around the specific issues that
you're interested in whether it's the environment,

676
00:51:20,319 --> 00:51:25,016
anti-racism or abortion rights--and see
how you can get involved.

677
00:51:25,040 --> 00:51:29,016
The good organizations will typically
have some sort of political education

678
00:51:29,040 --> 00:51:35,496
program which might cover some of the real life
events and topics I've discussed in this video.

679
00:51:35,520 --> 00:51:39,736
If you live in the United States, the
Democratic Socialists of America has

680
00:51:39,760 --> 00:51:45,496
chapters in states across the country --
shoutout to the AFROSOC caucus.

681
00:51:45,520 --> 00:51:49,176
Don't discount smaller groups either,
even if it's just a once a month reading

682
00:51:49,200 --> 00:51:56,696
group -- it's so useful to learn with a group of people,
to have conversations and debates, to become activated!

683
00:51:56,720 --> 00:52:01,335
Because everything I've described--from
the exploitation of the poor, to the

684
00:52:01,359 --> 00:52:07,416
destruction of the environment-- can
only be stopped if we organize ourselves.

685
00:52:07,440 --> 00:52:11,656
To paraphrase Barret and Aerith at
different points in Remake:

686
00:52:11,680 --> 00:52:15,416
"We don't want to look back one day and
wish we'd done it differently

687
00:52:15,440 --> 00:52:19,575
right here, right now, we need to keep
moving forward,
