00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,799
It's funny. Visiting Final Fantasy 7 Remake

2
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:06,960
nearly 20 years after playing the

3
00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:08,720
original release *really* put into

4
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:10,800
perspective how much of the original

5
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:12,080
just went over my head when I first

6
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:14,320
played it.

7
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:16,000
Because when Square presented a premise

8
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:18,880
of terrorists against an evil mega-corporation

9
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,920
corporation to a sheltered boy--

10
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:22,080
that boy being me--

11
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:24,640
I saw Robin Hood versus the Sheriff of

12
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:26,560
Nottingham, or the Rebel Alliance versus

13
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:28,160
the Galactic Empire.

14
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:30,720
To me, this starting point was more a

15
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:33,600
means to an end, with the "end" being

16
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:35,840
cool battles, cool set pieces, and an even

17
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:38,239
cooler silver-maned villain introduced in

18
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:40,239
the first few hours of playtime.

19
00:00:38,239 --> 00:00:42,079
Now, 20 years after my original

20
00:00:40,239 --> 00:00:44,559
playthrough, I went into Remake with

21
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:47,039
better critical thinking skills, a little

22
00:00:44,559 --> 00:00:49,360
more worldliness, and--of course--

23
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:51,360
a longstanding adderall prescription.

24
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:53,199
I became positioned like a goalie,

25
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:55,199
arms up and ready to intercept whatever

26
00:00:53,199 --> 00:00:56,800
Remake threw at me.

27
00:00:55,199 --> 00:00:59,359
And when the dust of my Remake

28
00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:02,239
playthrough settled, what do you think

29
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:02,239
I found in my hand?

30
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:06,560
Radical left...

31
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:09,799
*politics...?*

32
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:09,799
[Music]

33
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:15,040
dead generations presents

34
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:17,360
Is Final Fantasy VII a Radical, Left-Wing

35
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:17,360
Game?

36
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:24,400
Hello, I'm Vik for dead generations and

37
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:25,520
in this video, i plan to go on a journey

38
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:26,960
with you.

39
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:28,240
At the end of our journey we'll find an

40
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:30,159
answer to the question in the video

41
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:33,280
title, which we'll uncover by first

42
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:35,920
exploring the following two assertions:

43
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:37,280
1. There is a radical heart to 

44
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:40,159
Final Fantasy VII

45
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:42,799
and 2. Final Fantasy VII reflects

46
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:44,799
real-life radical left politics

47
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:46,880
Before I go on, I will warn you that this

48
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:48,880
video contains extensive spoilers for

49
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:51,600
the entire Compilation of Final Fantasy VII,

50
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:54,640
which includes the original game,

51
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:57,840
Remake, InterMISSION, and other sequels,

52
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:59,520
prequels, spin-offs... Kingdom Hearts...

53
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:01,040
The Kids Are All Right...

54
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:03,360
I've read through a lot of articles,

55
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:04,640
essays, book chapters, and manifestos to

56
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:06,479
write this video,

57
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:08,800
and you can see a list of the references

58
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:10,239
linked in the description below.

59
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:12,160
For the most part i tried to make sure

60
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:14,879
my sources weren't paywalled, and I

61
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:17,120
invite you to read, scrutinize, and most

62
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:19,040
importantly, *use* my sources as a

63
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:20,800
breadcrumb trail to learn more about

64
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:23,200
the stuff that I talk about.

65
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:24,800
That said feel free to teach me a thing

66
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:26,000
or ten in the comments,

67
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:27,040
especially if i've gotten something

68
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,080
wrong.

69
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:32,480
I have also added subtitles, time stamps,

70
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:34,080
a transcript, and all that fun stuff so

71
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:36,160
take advantage!

72
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:38,640
Now, let's begin by taking a closer look

73
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:42,319
at the foundational elements of

74
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:42,319
Final Fantasy VII's world building.

75
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:47,599
Chapter 1: Shinra and the Shitty pizza

76
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:53,599
Barret: "The upper world...a city on a plate...

77
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,840
It's 'cuz of that shitty 'pizza', that

78
00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:57,680
people underneath are sufferin'!

79
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:59,840
And the city below is full of polluted air.

80
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:02,800
On topa that the reactor keeps

81
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:04,879
drainin' up all the energy."

82
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:07,120
Cloud: "Then why doesn't everyone move on to the

83
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:08,319
Plate?"

84
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:10,800
"Barret: Dunno.

85
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:12,400
probably 'cuz they ain't got no money.

86
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:14,080
Or, maybe..."

87
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:17,519
'Cuz they love their land,

88
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:18,879
no matter how polluted it gets."

89
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:20,560
"Cloud: I know...

90
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:21,760
no one lives in the slums because they

91
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:23,599
want to.

92
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:25,360
It's like this train.

93
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:28,080
It can't run anywhere except where its

94
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:28,080
rails take it."

95
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:33,360
Remake introduces you to its most

96
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:35,519
prominent villain in the first few

97
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:37,760
minutes of gameplay. The Shinra Electric

98
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:39,519
Power Company, a mega-corporation that

99
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:41,519
literally uses the planet's lifeblood

100
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:43,440
to power their reactors.

101
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:45,280
You're also introduced to remake's

102
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:47,920
rendition of one of the most memorable

103
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:49,200
locations in all of video games: the city

104
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:50,720
of Midgar

105
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:53,120
There's an elevated section where

106
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:55,360
affluent and middle-class people live,

107
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:57,360
hundreds of feet above ground, and a

108
00:03:55,360 --> 00:04:00,480
ground-level section littered with

109
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:02,080
debris, pollution, and of course

110
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:03,519
poor people.

111
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:05,360
As the Midgar section of the game's

112
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:07,439
story progresses, you learn more about

113
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:09,680
the way the Shinra Company's remit is

114
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:12,879
closer to that of the nation-state than

115
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:14,720
that of the typical evil corporation:

116
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:16,400
It employs a large number of

117
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:18,479
Midgar's residents.

118
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:21,519
It maintains a police force in the form

119
00:04:18,479 --> 00:04:23,680
of the Shinra Public Security Forces.

120
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:25,919
It builds housing and infrastructure for

121
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:28,240
the city's residents.

122
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:30,800
It deploys its own paramilitary forces

123
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:33,120
in the form of SOLDIER and spies in the

124
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:35,040
form of the Turks in shady interventions

125
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:37,600
around the world.

126
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:41,440
It's even publicly engaged in a war with

127
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:41,440
Wutai, another nation-state.

128
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:46,639
Midgar does have a Mayor, Domino who is

129
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:49,520
more a Shinra Company figurehead than a

130
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:51,600
legitimate civil authority.

131
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:54,240
Let's begin to put all this into a wider

132
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:55,919
cultural and historic context. First off

133
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:57,199
a question i'm sure is on all of our

134
00:04:55,919 --> 00:04:59,199
minds right now:

135
00:04:57,199 --> 00:05:01,120
what's a city, anyway?

136
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:04,479
I'm going to draw heavily from Chapter 1

137
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:07,039
of 2017's Cities of Power by sociologist

138
00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:08,720
GÃ¶ran Therborn for this section and

139
00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:11,600
everything I'll reference can be read,

140
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:13,280
for free, via Google Books Preview.

141
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:15,120
Link in the description below.

142
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:17,039
Now, Therborn begins with a quote by

143
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:19,440
the historian Lewis Mumford that seems

144
00:05:17,039 --> 00:05:21,520
to be a succinct explanation that even a

145
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:25,800
toddler can understand.

146
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:25,800
A city is... um...

147
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:32,960
"a point of maximum concentration for the

148
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:34,639
power and culture of a community."

149
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:36,320
While Cities of Power is mostly

150
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:38,400
concerned with surveying real-world

151
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:40,320
capital cities, some of the lessons of

152
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:42,720
that first chapter are generalizable

153
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:45,199
enough to our discussion on Midgar.

154
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:47,039
In the Mumford quote, "Power" has political

155
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:49,039
and economic dimensions.

156
00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:51,440
We can understand "political power" as the

157
00:05:49,039 --> 00:05:53,520
authority granted "by coercion and or

158
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:55,280
persuasion through institutions and

159
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:57,600
processes of government."

160
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:59,919
To contextualize Therborn's definition:

161
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:02,160
I live in a city, and I have no choice

162
00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:04,240
but to defer to the political power

163
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:05,919
wielded by my city government in the

164
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:08,880
form of its management of public

165
00:06:05,919 --> 00:06:10,400
utilities, command over an army of cops,

166
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:13,680
its maintenance of the sidewalks and

167
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:15,440
roads I use to travel, and so on.

168
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:17,440
Relevant to us is the idea that

169
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:20,000
political power in cities can exist

170
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:22,319
alongside political counter-power, which

171
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:24,400
might take the form of protest rallies,

172
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:25,840
opposition movement headquarters, and 

173
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:28,160
so on.

174
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:30,000
We can understand "economic power" as the

175
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:32,639
concentration of capital--

176
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:34,319
engines of production like factories--

177
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:36,240
and wealth.

178
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:38,400
Power shapes cities in very important

179
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:40,880
ways including spatially.

180
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:42,639
For example, if a city center is secluded

181
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:45,680
from the periphery of a city, we can

182
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:47,600
infer an element of social exclusivity.

183
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:49,759
Therborn's characteristic example

184
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:51,919
being former South African apartheid

185
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:54,400
cities which had undeveloped wastelands

186
00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:56,000
separating non-white townships from

187
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:58,319
white city centers.

188
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,840
Even topography can be interpreted as a

189
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:02,160
power gradient.

190
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:04,479
Therborn specifically cites pre-modern

191
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:07,280
Edo, Japan, which saw lords living on

192
00:07:04,479 --> 00:07:08,880
hills and their retinue below them.

193
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:11,120
Our understanding of Midgar as a

194
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:13,440
concentration of power starts with three

195
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:15,840
words: the Shinra Company

196
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:17,840
1. The company provides reactors and

197
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:19,680
manufacturing facilities, and is where

198
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:20,800
the majority of the city's wealth is

199
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:23,520
tied.

200
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:25,360
2. Politically, we recall that the

201
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:27,440
Shinra Company effectively acts as

202
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:29,680
Midgar's government, providing public

203
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:31,199
services and infrastructure, in addition

204
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:32,319
to having the city's Mayor in their

205
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:34,479
pocket.

206
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:35,680
Importantly, we should try to recognize

207
00:07:34,479 --> 00:07:38,240
the existence of a political

208
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:40,319
counter-power in Midgar. The name escapes

209
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:42,720
me right now, but I'm thinking of an

210
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:44,400
environmental phenomenon, and I can't

211
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:46,160
quite recall it.

212
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:48,240
What? You're saying that I should know

213
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:49,599
since I wrote the script to this video?

214
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:51,360
Oh, you.

215
00:07:49,599 --> 00:07:52,800
Anyway, let's come back to that one a

216
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:54,879
little later.

217
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:56,720
We've placed Midgar in a sociopolitical

218
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:58,720
context, and in doing this we've

219
00:07:56,720 --> 00:08:01,280
reaffirmed the outsized role of the

220
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:03,280
Shinra Company as the city's literal and

221
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:05,520
figurative source of power.

222
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:07,840
Let's talk about this relationship. The

223
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:10,000
evil corporation is well-trodden ground

224
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:12,000
in fiction around the world, and it's

225
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,280
easy to see the trope as a sort of

226
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,280
creative rebellion against the

227
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:16,800
omnipresence of corporations in our

228
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:18,400
day-to-day lives.

229
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:20,240
If you're watching this video you've

230
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:23,599
probably encountered charts like this

231
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:26,319
one, created by Oxfam in 2014, which shows

232
00:08:23,599 --> 00:08:28,080
us that 10 companies own a lot of food

233
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:29,680
sold at supermarkets.

234
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:32,080
But more than a creative rebellion, the

235
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:34,159
trope is predicated on actual harmful

236
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:35,519
practices corporations have historically

237
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:38,000
engaged in.

238
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:39,120
We can relate a few examples to Shinra

239
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,839
and Midgar.

240
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:43,599
1. Company towns. Defined as a

241
00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:45,360
town with its buildings, amenities, and

242
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:47,600
businesses being owned by a single

243
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:49,519
company, and particularly prevalent in

244
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:52,080
the United States in the late 18th

245
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:53,760
century and early 19th century,

246
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:55,440
the concept is rife with problems for

247
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:57,040
the people actually working there.

248
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:59,040
Workers were subject to poor living

249
00:08:57,040 --> 00:09:00,959
conditions, and the rent for these living

250
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:02,560
spaces would be higher than rent in

251
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:04,720
surrounding areas.

252
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:06,640
As company towns were fairly isolated,

253
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:09,040
workers who might have undertaken long

254
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:10,720
distance migration to reach these towns

255
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:12,720
didn't have many options for making an

256
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:14,880
equivalent wage elsewhere.

257
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:16,640
This bind gave workers little choice but

258
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:18,399
to essentially give back a portion of

259
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:21,279
their wages to the company in exchange

260
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:23,839
for lodging, goods and services

261
00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:25,920
If this setup sounds deeply exploitative--

262
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:28,240
that's because it is.

263
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:30,000
And if workers deigned to organize and

264
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:32,240
strike in response to these unfair

265
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,600
conditions, the consequences would be

266
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:36,240
disastrous.

267
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:38,800
The Ludlow Massacre of 1914 demonstrated

268
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:40,640
this morbidly well, in which the Colorado

269
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:42,800
Fuel and Iron Company, owned by the

270
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:44,800
Rockefeller Family, brought in the

271
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:47,200
Colorado National Guard and its own

272
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:49,440
gunman to attack a camp of striking

273
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:50,720
miners from the United Mine Workers of

274
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:52,959
America.

275
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:54,800
This led to over a dozen miners, their

276
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:56,000
spouses, and their children being

277
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:58,720
murdered.

278
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:00,800
We can interpret Remake's Midgar as the

279
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:02,320
highest stage of the company town.

280
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:04,560
It's a settlement that's effectively

281
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:06,320
owned by the Shinra Company it's fairly

282
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:07,920
isolated from its closest neighboring

283
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:10,000
settlement, Kalm,

284
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:13,120
and the existence of the city cannot be

285
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:14,560
decoupled from its mako reactors.

286
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:16,720
There's a core of people who live in

287
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:19,600
Midgar so they can work on and maintain

288
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:22,000
those reactors, and everything else--

289
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:24,560
--the police force, the housing, the

290
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:26,959
infrastructure, and even businesses like

291
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:29,279
Sam's Delivery Service either directly

292
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:31,680
or indirectly serve that core.

293
00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:33,680
The natural resources and wealth that

294
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:36,160
are extracted from the system end up

295
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:38,320
literally flowing upwards to the Shinra

296
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:40,560
Company HQ.

297
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:42,640
Boy, I sure am glad we're nearly a

298
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:45,680
century out from the era of towns like

Dismal working Conditions that fanned a stir. "In a room where

00:10:53,839 --> 00:10:56,959

Ahem. 2. Paramilitaries.

326

Multinationals have long been accused of

327

funding paramilitaries to brutally

enforce their profit-driven goals in

00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:12,880
We can look further back at the British

338
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:14,959
East India Company, what we might

339
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:16,320
consider the world's first multinational

340
00:12:14,959 --> 00:12:18,240
corporation.

341
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:20,720
The company's activities led to the

342
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:23,360
subjugation of the region of Bengal in

343
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:25,600
South Asia in the mid-18th century.

344
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:27,680
Bengal was then used as a staging ground

345
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:30,399
for the conquest of the rest of the

346
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:32,399
subcontinent over the next century. 

347
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:34,560
The looting of South Asia, the seizure of its

348
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:37,360
property and wealth, was executed by the

349
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:39,120
use of a private army trained and paid

350
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:41,040
by the Company.

351
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:43,519
The Shinra Company evokes this paradigm

352
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:46,079
of colonialism in their use of SOLDIER

353
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:47,760
to intervene in places like Wutai. Before

354
00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:49,920
the events of Remake, the Shinra Company

355
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:51,360
planned to establish a mako reactor in

356
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:53,279
the nation of Wutai.

357
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:55,839
This understandably set off alarm bells

358
00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:56,560
with the Wutains because... why 

359
00:12:55,839 --> 00:12:58,720
wouldn't it?

360
00:12:56,560 --> 00:13:01,519
But more specifically, the Wutains had

361
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:03,040
seen the way mako reactors were used to

362
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:05,120
consolidate the Shinra Company's

363
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:07,839
economic and political control over a

364
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:10,639
region. This initial resistance, of course,

365
00:13:07,839 --> 00:13:12,320
escalated into a war between Wutai and

366
00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:14,639
the Shinra Company.

367
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:17,600
Now, as an aside if we go through records

368
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:20,399
of the Shinra Company colonizers--yes, I

369
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:22,160
said it, colonizers who participated in

370
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:23,760
the Wutai campaign,

371
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:24,560
there's the villainous Sephiroth of

372
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:26,639
course,

373
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:27,680
but look a little closer and who else do

374
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:30,639
you see?

375
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:32,639
Why, it's the fandom's favorite boy Zach

376
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:36,480
Fair. I'm sorry to break it to you all,

377
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:39,199
but your fave is a war criminal.

378
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:40,959
3. Corporations and Government.

379
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:43,360
Now, a lot of the real life history that

380
00:13:40,959 --> 00:13:44,880
I've spoken about so far was facilitated

381
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:46,480
with the consent of most of the

382
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:48,560
governments involved.

383
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:50,240
In Ludlow, the Rockefellers leveraged

384
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:52,800
their influence to get the Governor of

385
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:55,120
Colorado to mobilize the Colorado

386
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:56,320
National Guard to kill miners and their

387
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:58,160
families.

388
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:59,920
In Colombia, Chiquita's alleged

389
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:02,240
collaboration with right-wing death

390
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:05,040
squads was often condoned by whichever

391
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:07,279
government was in power at the time.

392
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:09,440
The British East India Company counted

393
00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:12,079
numerous supporters and shareholders

394
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:14,720
among member of parliament and waged its

395
00:14:12,079 --> 00:14:16,560
bloody campaign in South Asia with the

396
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:18,079
permission of the crown.

397
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:20,240
There are probably countless examples I

398
00:14:18,079 --> 00:14:22,560
can add to this section like the issue

399
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:25,680
of think tanks and lobbyists advancing

400
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:27,839
corporate interests in the United States.

401
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:30,160
Did you know that some go as far as to

402
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:32,639
write model legislation that can be

403
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:34,560
copied and submitted by lawmakers with

404
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:36,399
some edits?

405
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:38,160
Or the age-old tradition of governments

406
00:14:36,399 --> 00:14:40,639
around the world selling national

407
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:42,160
institutions and natural resources to

408
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:44,079
corporate interests?

409
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:46,959
Just look at the privatization of

410
00:14:44,079 --> 00:14:49,279
Chile's education, healthcare, social

411
00:14:46,959 --> 00:14:51,760
security, and copper mines during the

412
00:14:49,279 --> 00:14:53,199
brutally repressive Pinochet regime in

413
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:55,199
the 80s.

414
00:14:53,199 --> 00:14:57,199
When we bring this back to Final Fantasy VII,

415
00:14:55,199 --> 00:14:59,760
we see the broad theme of corporate

416
00:14:57,199 --> 00:15:01,519
power outstripping government power in

417
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:02,959
the Shinra Company's relationship with

418
00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:04,880
Mayor Domino.

419
00:15:02,959 --> 00:15:06,720
His office is placed in an obscure part

420
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:08,880
of the Shinra Company headquarters, and

421
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:10,959
his actual governing responsibilities

422
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:12,720
are very minimal, save for issuing a

423
00:15:10,959 --> 00:15:14,720
temporary state of emergency towards the

424
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:17,600
beginning of the game.

425
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:20,800
"The mayor is the best," more like

426
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:23,199
"capitalism is the worst,"

427
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:25,279
am I right folks?

428
00:15:23,199 --> 00:15:27,440
It's easy to dismiss these parallels and

429
00:15:25,279 --> 00:15:29,839
consider the way Midgar and Shinra are

430
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:31,120
conveyed in final fantasy vii as purely

431
00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:33,279
aesthetic.

432
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:35,360
You can say the megacity, the futuristic

433
00:15:33,279 --> 00:15:37,839
tech, and Chadley the intern are just

434
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:39,519
there to evoke cyberpunk coolness, and

435
00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:41,199
there's no intentional engagement with

436
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:42,880
left-wing politics.

437
00:15:41,199 --> 00:15:44,240
But i think it's clear that the writers

438
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:46,560
of the original game and Remake,

439
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:48,959
Kazushige Nojima and company, were

440
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:50,160
explicitly engaging with anti-capitalist

441
00:15:48,959 --> 00:15:51,279
themes.

442
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:53,440
And why?

443
00:15:51,279 --> 00:15:55,600
If the historical parallels alone aren't

444
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:57,360
enough, what tips the scale?

445
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:59,600
The answer lies in the ideological

446
00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:01,839
opposition to the Shinra Company, the

447
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:03,759
political counter-power named after an

448
00:16:01,839 --> 00:16:06,399
environmental phenomenon,

449
00:16:03,759 --> 00:16:06,399
Avalanche.

450
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:11,920
Chapter 2: A Framework for Avalanche

451
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:17,440
Barret: "Okay then. 

452
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:20,560
Let's talk about wasteful indulgences.

453
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:24,480
What is mako? The lifestream!

454
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:26,480
the lifeblood of the planet--our planet!

455
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:28,399
But shinra keeps on slurping it up like

456
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:30,800
a thirsty dog! Whadda you think's gonna

457
00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:32,720
happen if you don't stop huh, huh!?" 

458
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:35,040
Frameworks are an important part of any serious

459
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:37,279
critical analysis, whether it's of a TV

460
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:39,040
show, a video game, or even events

461
00:16:37,279 --> 00:16:40,399
happening in the world.

462
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:43,600
For the purpose of this video, let's

463
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:46,800
define a "framework," also known as a "lens,"

464
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:48,880
or a "frame of reference," or a "perspective"

465
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:50,560
as the analytical approach we take when

466
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:52,639
we interpret a subject.

467
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:54,480
This analytical approach can be informed

468
00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:56,959
by a school of thought, historical

469
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:58,720
patterns, or other ideas.

470
00:16:56,959 --> 00:17:00,800
For example, my discussion of Final

471
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:03,279
Fantasy VII so far has employed a

472
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:05,120
framework that's attuned to social and

473
00:17:03,279 --> 00:17:07,360
economic inequalities and their

474
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:08,640
relationship to capitalism.

475
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:10,880
We'll call this framework

476
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:13,039
"anti-capitalism."

477
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:15,120
Now, in reading through Remake's script, I

478
00:17:13,039 --> 00:17:17,199
thought Barret's "wasteful indulgences"

479
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:18,400
speech to President Shinra and the

480
00:17:17,199 --> 00:17:20,079
people of Midgar

481
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:22,240
was probably the most complete

482
00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:23,600
expression of Avalanche's goals in the

483
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:26,000
base game.

484
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:27,600
A planet is a living organism, the Shinra

485
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:30,000
Company is extracting the planet's

486
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:31,760
lifeblood, and severe consequences lie

487
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:33,039
ahead for the planet if that process

488
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:35,360
isn't stopped.

489
00:17:33,039 --> 00:17:36,880
This is why Avalanche must stop the

490
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:38,640
Shinra Company.

491
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:41,039
So we can consider the framework of

492
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:43,520
Barret's analysis as one that's broadly

493
00:17:41,039 --> 00:17:45,919
"environmental" - a perspective concerned

494
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:48,480
with the welfare of the planet. But let's

495
00:17:45,919 --> 00:17:50,160
put a pin in that speech for a second.

496
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:52,080
There are a number of real-life

497
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:54,559
left-wing resistance groups which can be

498
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:56,240
cited as analogues to Avalanche, ranging

499
00:17:54,559 --> 00:17:59,600
from Weather Underground of the United

500
00:17:56,240 --> 00:18:01,200
States to the Naxalites in India.

501
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:03,280
Without getting too far into the weeds

502
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:05,679
of perfect comparisons, i'd like to look

503
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:08,160
at an organization that is ostensibly

504
00:18:05,679 --> 00:18:09,760
different from Avalanche in most ways,

505
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:11,600
save for their concern around

506
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:14,400
environmental destruction.

507
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:17,120
Let's talk about Extinction Rebellion UK,

508
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:20,240
or XR UK for short.

509
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:22,960
XR UK was established in October 2018 to

510
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:25,039
combat the ongoing climate emergency. The

511
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:26,720
group uses a strategy of non-violent

512
00:18:25,039 --> 00:18:29,440
civil disobedience, which includes

513
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:31,440
tactics such as occupying public spaces,

514
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:34,000
blocking roads and bridges, and having

515
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:35,840
its members be arrested en masse to

516
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:37,600
overwhelm court systems.

517
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:39,679
Generally, the goal of XR UK

518
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:42,400
demonstrations is to compel governments

519
00:18:39,679 --> 00:18:43,679
to urgently act against climate change.

520
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:45,840
This can be done through citizen

521
00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:47,919
cssemblies, or bodies of citizens

522
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:51,039
advising governments on environmental

523
00:18:47,919 --> 00:18:53,679
policy. What hangs over all this is

524
00:18:51,039 --> 00:18:54,880
XR UK's long-standing demand to "Go Beyond

525
00:18:53,679 --> 00:18:56,640
Politics."

526
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:59,120
In an article for Current Affairs

527
00:18:56,640 --> 00:19:01,120
journalist Erica X Eisen writes that

528
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:03,760
while the slogan is linked to XR's

529
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:05,840
demand to create citizens' assemblies,

530
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:07,679
it's also worded that way to draw in a

531
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:10,320
large amount of supporters, even those

532
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:12,480
who may consider themselves apolitical.

533
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:14,480
Eisen states that "Go Beyond Politics"

534
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:16,080
pivots too far away from a framework

535
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:17,840
that might explain what's driving the

536
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:20,000
climate emergency.

537
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:22,240
Eisen and i view the climate emergency

538
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:24,480
through an anti-capitalist lens.

539
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:26,559
We see the primary demand of capitalism.

540
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:28,799
endless growth. as fundamentally

541
00:19:26,559 --> 00:19:30,320
incompatible with the finite resources

542
00:19:28,799 --> 00:19:31,840
of our planet.

543
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:34,720
So when i read Barret's "wasteful

544
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:38,320
indulgences" speech, I'm reminded of

545
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:39,840
XR UK's "Go Beyond Politics" slogan--they both

546
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:42,000
have environmental concerns at the

547
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:44,080
forefront, but the framework is missing

548
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:45,200
that little extra bit to tie it all

549
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:48,000
together.

550
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:50,480
It's missing a link to the root cause of

551
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:52,400
all this: capitalism.

552
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:54,480
Speaking of, let's take that pin out of

553
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:57,039
Barret's speech now and test the

554
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:58,480
limitations of Avalanche's environmental

555
00:19:57,039 --> 00:20:00,799
perspective.

556
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:02,720
Let's try a thought experiment: we start

557
00:20:00,799 --> 00:20:05,039
by asking ourselves, would Barret's

558
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:07,760
concerns be sufficiently addressed if

559
00:20:05,039 --> 00:20:10,080
mako reactors were replaced with... oh,

560
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:11,679
I don't know, *oil wells?*

561
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:13,840
Would it be too out of line to imagine a

562
00:20:11,679 --> 00:20:15,840
post-Shinra world, where Barret, having

563
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:18,400
succeeded in the elimination of mako

564
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:21,600
reactors, is totally fine with burning

565
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:23,840
oil for energy? A post-Shinra world where

566
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:24,799
Barrett has a puffer vest and a fishnet

567
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:25,919
shirt?

568
00:20:24,799 --> 00:20:27,360
Do we know enough about Barret's

569
00:20:25,919 --> 00:20:29,520
perspective in Remake to make an

570
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:31,919
argument for or against oil fields 

571
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:31,919
and

572
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:38,320
fishnet shirts!? Ahem. To be fair to XR UK, the

573
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:40,720
organization as a whole is intentionally

574
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:42,559
decentralized so not everyone has to

575
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:44,000
agree with "Go Beyond Politics" to

576
00:20:42,559 --> 00:20:46,159
participate.

577
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:49,039
And while "Go Beyond Politics" has had a

578
00:20:46,159 --> 00:20:50,960
presence in XR UK's branding, there are

579
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:52,640
rank-and-file members who do participate

580
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:55,039
in the organization with an

581
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:57,520
anti-capitalist framework.

582
00:20:55,039 --> 00:21:00,000
And to be fair to Remake, Barret does

583
00:20:57,520 --> 00:21:02,640
comment on a Shinra employee being blind

584
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:04,240
to his "corporate masters profiting from

585
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:06,320
the planet's pain."

586
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:08,559
un a scene that both adds a smidge of

587
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:10,480
depth to Avalanche's politics in the base

588
00:21:08,559 --> 00:21:11,919
game, and is a great character moment for

589
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:14,320
Barret.

590
00:21:11,919 --> 00:21:17,039
Additionally, a member of Avalanche calls

591
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:20,080
the Shinra Company fascists during a

592
00:21:17,039 --> 00:21:22,799
shootout at the Sector 7 Pillar, which

593
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:24,640
you know, *I* won't argue with.

594
00:21:22,799 --> 00:21:27,120
With all that said, I think it's useful

595
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:29,120
for us to go back to the original game.

596
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:31,120
Let's take a look

597
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:32,640
Barret: "You saw that village.

598
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:35,440
It's always the powerless that get

599
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:37,039
victimized by tyrants like Shinra.

600
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:38,640
The one's with the power control those

601
00:21:37,039 --> 00:21:40,240
without it. It's just the way of the

602
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:42,320
world now.

603
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:45,039
I can't let 'em do that. That's why I

604
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:47,200
formed AVALANCHE to fight them."

605
00:21:45,039 --> 00:21:49,039
This dialogue is actually inaccessible

606
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:51,120
in the original game because of a bug

607
00:21:49,039 --> 00:21:53,679
that prevents it from triggering.

608
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:55,360
You'd read this dialogue in Gongaga,

609
00:21:53,679 --> 00:21:57,440
settlement in ruin thanks to the

610
00:21:55,360 --> 00:22:00,080
explosion of a mako reactor a little

611
00:21:57,440 --> 00:22:02,000
while before the events of the game.

612
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:03,840
It's a shame that this dialogue is lost

613
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:06,400
to a lot of players, because it better

614
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:09,039
establishes Barret's perspective, and by

615
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:10,799
extension, Avalanche's perspective.

616
00:22:09,039 --> 00:22:13,440
They're not just people who want to

617
00:22:10,799 --> 00:22:14,640
preserve the Lifestream, but they see a

618
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:17,200
throughline between the Shinra

619
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:19,440
Company's extraction of mako and the

620
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:20,960
Shinra Company's oppression of people

621
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:22,960
around the world.

622
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:24,880
The InterMISSION chapters take the

623
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:27,360
spirit of this bit of dialogue,

624
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:28,640
marries it to that smidge of depth from

625
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:30,720
Barret's remake dialogue that I

626
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:31,919
mentioned earlier, and gives us the

627
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:33,600
following:

628
00:22:31,919 --> 00:22:36,480
Sonon: "Before you got here, I did a little bit

629
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:38,000
of recon. Found out what they want.

630
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:39,600
Free elections, workers' rights

631
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:43,039
workers' rights,

632
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:43,039
fair distribution of wealth...

633
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:49,440
... Amazing.

634
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:51,600
"Are those my glasses?"

635
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:54,240
Um... No?

636
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:56,720
But seriously, the dialogue is so

637
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:58,640
explicitly coded as "leftist" that it's

638
00:22:56,720 --> 00:23:00,799
almost in-your-face.

639
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:03,280
Just as a brief example, the twin demands

640
00:23:00,799 --> 00:23:05,840
of "workers rights" and "fair distribution

641
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:06,720
of wealth" come up a lot in 

642
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:08,240
Marxist thought.

643
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:10,960
This school of thought describes the

644
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:13,760
relationship of "workers"--individuals who

645
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:15,360
sell their labor to the "ruling class"--

646
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:18,000
individuals who own the means that

647
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:20,320
workers use to perform their labor.

648
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:22,480
Marxism views this relationship as an

649
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:24,240
unequal arrangement that sees one side

650
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:26,559
accumulating just enough to continue

651
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:29,280
living, while the other side hoards and

652
00:23:26,559 --> 00:23:31,760
defends wealth that they didn't create.

653
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:33,600
The way to upend this relationship is by

654
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:35,840
organizing workers against the ruling

655
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:37,679
class, which leads to victories like

656
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:39,440
better working conditions, the

657
00:23:37,679 --> 00:23:42,320
redistribution of wealth from the top to

658
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:44,240
the bottom, and ultimately the end of the

659
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:46,640
system that relies on this awful

660
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:49,120
relationship in the first place.

661
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:51,360
And before you say anything, no, I don't

662
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:52,799
think i'd call this game "Marxist." I'll go

663
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:54,640
into this at length a little later in

664
00:23:52,799 --> 00:23:56,640
the video, but there are a few small

665
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:58,559
issues that prevent me from canonizing

666
00:23:56,640 --> 00:24:01,440
Final Fantasy VII in the cultural

667
00:23:58,559 --> 00:24:05,120
Marxism canon alongside classic works of

668
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:08,960
art like the Battle of Algiers and...

669
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:08,960
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince?

670
00:24:10,159 --> 00:24:12,720
... Whoa...

671
00:24:11,279 --> 00:24:14,640
Apparently, in the extended cut of the

672
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:16,240
film, the waitress from the introduction

673
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:18,080
stares directly at the camera and

674
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:20,240
implores the viewer to support union

675
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:22,720
drives.

676
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:26,000
Harry Potter and the Waitress at Treats

677
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:28,080
is now my prevailing headcanon and OTP,

678
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:30,240
and I think it would make a fine AO3

679
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:31,120
title, and I hope somebody will get on

680
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:33,279
that

681
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:36,080
and give us the ending to the series

682
00:24:33,279 --> 00:24:36,960
that we all deserve.

683
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:38,960
Um...

684
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:40,799
Moving on...

685
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:42,640
If we take Barret's dialogue in Remake

686
00:24:40,799 --> 00:24:44,400
alone, there is some plausible

687
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:46,000
deniability against radical left

688
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:47,120
politics and the game's depiction of

689
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:49,120
Avalanche.

690
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:51,200
You might argue "Avalanche is beyond

691
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:53,200
politics, they just blame the Shinra

692
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:54,640
Company for hurting the planet."

693
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:56,720
But the context we're given in the

694
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:59,120
original, InterMISSION and the world we

695
00:24:56,720 --> 00:25:01,440
inhabit very concretely place Avalanche's

696
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:02,480
goals and actions in an anti-capitalist

697
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:05,600
framework.

698
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:07,840
To quote Barret in 2022: multinational

699
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:10,320
corporations are still [quote] destroying

700
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:13,440
our planet just to build their power and

701
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:16,240
line their own damn pockets with gold

702
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:16,240
[end quote]

703
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:22,799
Chapter 3: Radical Hearts, Radical Mirrors

704
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:28,320
We began with this question:

705
00:25:25,679 --> 00:25:29,200
"Is Final Fantasy VII a radical left-wing

706
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:31,039
game?"

707
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:32,559
To answer this question I made two

708
00:25:31,039 --> 00:25:35,200
assertions.

709
00:25:32,559 --> 00:25:36,559
First, there is a radical heart to 

710
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:39,279
Final Fantasy VII.

711
00:25:36,559 --> 00:25:42,320
Second, Final Fantasy VII reflects

712
00:25:39,279 --> 00:25:44,640
real-world radical left politics. I think

713
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:46,559
the *radical heart* of Final Fantasy VII

714
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:49,200
Is made manifest in the relationships

715
00:25:46,559 --> 00:25:50,240
between Avalanche, Midgar and the Shinra

716
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:52,320
Company.

717
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:55,360
Those relationships convey in-universe

718
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:57,200
ideologies that read to us as radical

719
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:59,840
because they *reflect* certain historical

720
00:25:57,200 --> 00:26:01,520
patterns, political theory, and the state

721
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:02,960
of the world today.

722
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:04,320
Let's go over what we've discussed so

723
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:06,640
far.

724
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:08,720
1. Avalanche is an organization of

725
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:10,320
radical environmentalists who interpret

726
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:12,720
the actions of their enemy through an

727
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:14,640
anti-capitalist lens.

728
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:16,720
2. The enemy that avalanche fights

729
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:18,320
against, the enemy that destroys the

730
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:21,440
environment and oppresses people around

731
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:23,600
the world, is the Shinra Company.

732
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:25,600
3. The monument to Shinra's Global

733
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:27,840
campaign of environmental destruction

734
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:30,320
and domination of its inhabitants, the

735
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:32,880
place that puts the "under" in "underclass,"

736
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:35,120
the expired pizza that rots the land--

737
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:37,120
is the city of Midgar.

738
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:39,520
This ever beating heart propels much of

739
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:41,120
what happens in Remake proper.

740
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:43,120
We know that the shinra company's

741
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:46,320
process of accumulating wealth has had

742
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:48,880
tremendous consequences like war, murder,

743
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:51,760
kidnapping, massacres, environmental

744
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:53,679
destruction, and economic inequality.

745
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:57,520
We know that these consequences brought

746
00:26:53,679 --> 00:26:59,120
Cloud, Barret, Tifa Aerith and Red XIII to

747
00:26:57,520 --> 00:27:00,240
Midgar at different points of their

748
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:02,159
lives.

749
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:04,240
We know that after arriving in Midgar,

750
00:27:02,159 --> 00:27:06,320
the lives of these characters converge

751
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:08,320
in part because of additional shinra

752
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:09,440
company fuckery during the events of

753
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:12,000
Remake.

754
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:14,159
But is that the end of this video?

755
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:16,159
Well, if we want to absolutely,

756
00:27:14,159 --> 00:27:18,159
definitively, and concretely conclude

757
00:27:16,159 --> 00:27:20,720
that Remake has the promise of radical

758
00:27:18,159 --> 00:27:23,600
left politics, it behooves us to see

759
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:25,840
where Remake falls short of that promise.

760
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:30,559
Let's look at two examples, starting with

761
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:30,559
a closer examination of Barret Wallace.

762
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:36,320
Chapter 4: The Trouble with 

763
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:36,320
Barret Wallace

764
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:39,679
What does it mean that most of the

765
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:42,559
radical Barret quotes I cited in the

766
00:27:39,679 --> 00:27:44,240
last chapter came from the original game?

767
00:27:42,559 --> 00:27:46,399
When you look at the equivalent sections

768
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:48,240
in Remake's script--the sections in which

769
00:27:46,399 --> 00:27:51,279
you'd expect Barret to make the same

770
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:53,679
indictments of inequality except in 

771
00:27:51,279 --> 00:27:55,520
60 frames per second with full voice-acting-- 

772
00:27:53,679 --> 00:27:57,279
they're not there.

773
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:59,679
Consider the train ride after the

774
00:27:57,279 --> 00:28:01,919
bombing of Reactor Number 1.

775
00:27:59,679 --> 00:28:04,000
In the original game, that's where the

776
00:28:01,919 --> 00:28:06,320
"fucking 'pizza'" conversation happens

777
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:08,399
between Barret and Cloud.

778
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:10,960
We're specifically told that lack of

779
00:28:08,399 --> 00:28:13,120
money and love of the land keep the poor

780
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:15,520
on the lower plate.

781
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:17,840
In Remake this conversation shifts much

782
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:20,559
of the focus to the mako reactor's...

783
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:22,720
adverse effects on soil and air.

784
00:28:20,559 --> 00:28:24,799
Consider also the aftermath of the

785
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:27,360
Sector 7 plate fall.

786
00:28:24,799 --> 00:28:29,039
In the original game, Tifa wonders aloud

787
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:30,720
if Shinra razed the Sector and

788
00:28:29,039 --> 00:28:32,000
massacred its people because of

789
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:34,159
Avalanche.

790
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:36,399
Barret replies that the atrocity is

791
00:28:34,159 --> 00:28:38,640
Shinra's fault and it's "always been

792
00:28:36,399 --> 00:28:40,640
the Shinra" -- they're destroying the planet

793
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:42,720
for profit.

794
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:45,360
In Remake, Tifa expresses the same

795
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:46,880
sentiment, and Barret again emphasizes

796
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:48,320
that the massacre is the Shinra

797
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:50,080
Company's fault...

798
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:51,919
but the more radical line about profit

799
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:53,679
is excised.

800
00:28:51,919 --> 00:28:55,679
It's like Remakes writers took the

801
00:28:53,679 --> 00:28:58,240
original character's anti-capitalist

802
00:28:55,679 --> 00:29:00,399
framework and replaced it with the less

803
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:02,480
severe "environmental" framework we

804
00:29:00,399 --> 00:29:04,880
discussed earlier.

805
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:07,200
Or, to use a more relatable analogy for

806
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:09,279
today's generation, the proletarian

807
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:11,840
Barret of the original game has been

808
00:29:09,279 --> 00:29:13,760
replaced by the renegade Barret in

809
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:14,720
Remake.

810
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:16,159
... get it?

811
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:18,640
like the, uh,

812
00:29:16,159 --> 00:29:21,120
like the 1918 polemic that Vladimir

813
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:22,559
Lenin wrote against Karl Kautsky?

814
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:24,559
Um...

815
00:29:22,559 --> 00:29:27,360
make sure you like and subscribe for

816
00:29:24,559 --> 00:29:29,120
more topical political content.

817
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:31,120
When we consider the way Remake reins

818
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:32,799
in Barret's anti-capitalist rhetoric,

819
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:35,360
and the way the game focuses more on

820
00:29:32,799 --> 00:29:37,600
Avalanche's "collateral damage" in the form

821
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:39,360
of Midgar residents being harmed and

822
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:40,640
property being destroyed compared to the

823
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:41,760
original game,

824
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:44,159
we should keep in mind that this

825
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:46,080
political shift was done deliberately.

826
00:29:44,159 --> 00:29:49,360
Here's what Remake's Director Motomu

827
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:51,279
Toriyama had to say in an interview:

828
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:53,279
"... when the original came out we were all

829
00:29:51,279 --> 00:29:54,799
pretty young and things like 'is it

830
00:29:53,279 --> 00:29:56,960
really right to destroy the mako

831
00:29:54,799 --> 00:29:59,200
reactors to save the planet?' didn't

832
00:29:56,960 --> 00:30:00,880
really cross our minds at all. However,

833
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:03,120
with the remake a lot of things have

834
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:05,200
happened in the real world, so we as the

835
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:07,360
developers have a responsibility to

836
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:10,320
figure out how to make things relate as

837
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:12,000
well as how far to go."

838
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:13,440
As a result of this shift, 

839
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:15,760
Remake Barret's strongest indictment of the

840
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:18,159
Shinra Company's accumulation of wealth--

841
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:20,240
their "profiting from the planet's pain"--

842
00:30:18,159 --> 00:30:21,840
is in a single line in a missable

843
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:23,440
cutscene in the Shinra Company

844
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:25,279
Headquarters.

845
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:27,679
We also see a notable divergence from

846
00:30:25,279 --> 00:30:29,360
the original game's plot and Remake

847
00:30:27,679 --> 00:30:31,039
the version of Avalanche that we see at

848
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:33,200
the start of the game is no longer a

849
00:30:31,039 --> 00:30:35,520
group that Barret founded, it's now a

850
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:37,760
much larger organization comprised of a

851
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:40,080
headquarters and multiple cells.

852
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:42,399
Avalanche HQ considers Barret's cell

853
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:44,640
too extreme, and by the start of the game,

854
00:30:42,399 --> 00:30:46,399
his group operates as a splinter cell

855
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:48,399
detached from the larger Avalanche

856
00:30:46,399 --> 00:30:50,559
organization.

857
00:30:48,399 --> 00:30:52,559
I'm tentatively watching to see how this

858
00:30:50,559 --> 00:30:54,559
plot update plays out in future

859
00:30:52,559 --> 00:30:56,320
installments, but in the context of

860
00:30:54,559 --> 00:30:57,840
Remake and InterMISSION

861
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:59,840
I think it's not the greatest attempt at

862
00:30:57,840 --> 00:31:01,919
adding nuance.

863
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:04,000
My bone to pick with this plot thread is

864
00:31:01,919 --> 00:31:05,919
political: we never see what the more

865
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:08,000
"moderate" strategy of addressing the

866
00:31:05,919 --> 00:31:10,320
Shinra Company's runaway oppression and

867
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:11,760
environmental destruction looks like.

868
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:14,080
Moreover, the final word on the

869
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:16,320
ideological conflict between the more

870
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:20,159
extreme and moderate sides of avalanche

871
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:22,320
is given to us by Sonon in InterMISSION.

872
00:31:20,159 --> 00:31:23,200
Sonon: "Hey, about what you said earlier." 

873
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:26,399
Yuffie: "Which was...?"

874
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:28,720
Sonon: "About Avalanche--how it's changed." Yuffie: "Oh. That."

875
00:31:26,399 --> 00:31:30,559
Sonon: "These people are too soft. But those

876
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:32,080
splinter cell guys?

877
00:31:30,559 --> 00:31:34,559
*They* sound like the ones we should have

878
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:37,760
teamed up with. Don't you think?" 

879
00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:39,440
For what it's worth Sonon... I think so.

880
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:41,200
One other area that could have actually

881
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:44,080
used more nuance in the final product

882
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:45,440
was Barret's blaxploitation-inspired...

883
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:46,880
everything.

884
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:48,640
That's, right I couldn't make a video

885
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:50,480
about the radical politics of Final

886
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:52,140
Fantasy VII without addressing the

887
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:55,239
elephant in the room:

888
00:31:52,140 --> 00:31:55,239
Barret: "Duhn-duhn-duhn-*duhn*, duhn duhn, *duhn*-da-*duhn*!" "Suck on this!"

889
00:31:56,720 --> 00:32:02,720
"Where could they be going...?

890
00:31:59,279 --> 00:32:05,919
Embarking on an adventure to find some

891
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:07,919
treasure!?" "Suck on this!" "This pump's sole

892
00:32:05,919 --> 00:32:10,159
purpose is to drain the planet dry.

893
00:32:07,919 --> 00:32:12,960
While you sleep, while you eat, while you

894
00:32:10,159 --> 00:32:16,159
shit--it's here, sucking up mako.

895
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:19,919
It doesn't rest and it doesn't care!

896
00:32:16,159 --> 00:32:22,960
You do realize what mako is, don't you?

897
00:32:19,919 --> 00:32:25,120
Mako is the lifeblood of our world.

898
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:26,480
The planet bleeds green like you and me

899
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:28,000
bleed red.

900
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:32,080
The hell you think's gonna happen when

901
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:32,080
it's all gone, huh!? Answer me!

902
00:32:32,159 --> 00:32:36,000
You gonna stand there and pretend you

903
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:39,960
can't hear the planet crying out in

904
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:39,960
pain?" "Open wide!

905
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:46,159
And suck on this!"

906
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:56,799
Black representation in mainstream media

907
00:32:53,279 --> 00:32:58,720
has traditionally had a lot of problems.

908
00:32:56,799 --> 00:32:59,679
How do i define the scope of mainstream

909
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:02,000
media--

910
00:32:59,679 --> 00:33:04,159
Is a game from Japan really a part of

911
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:05,279
mainstream media in the English-speaking

912
00:33:04,159 --> 00:33:07,760
world?

913
00:33:05,279 --> 00:33:09,679
well i live in the United States, and

914
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:12,399
within the past 10 or more years, our

915
00:33:09,679 --> 00:33:15,600
national conversations around literature,

916
00:33:12,399 --> 00:33:17,440
movies, television shows, and video games

917
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:19,200
have included work from other places

918
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:21,360
around the world.

919
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:23,840
This isn't the result of happenstance,

920
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:26,799
but intentional.

921
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:29,200
For example, the 2021 anti-capitalist

922
00:33:26,799 --> 00:33:31,679
sensation Squid Game didn't cross over

923
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:33,919
from people living in South Korea to a

924
00:33:31,679 --> 00:33:36,799
U.S. audience by word-of-mouth,

925
00:33:33,919 --> 00:33:38,399
but according to creator Hwang Dong-hyuk,

926
00:33:36,799 --> 00:33:41,279
it was intentionally written and

927
00:33:38,399 --> 00:33:43,200
marketed for a global audience.

928
00:33:41,279 --> 00:33:45,120
How do i define the problems of black

929
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:46,640
representation in media?

930
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:49,519
The typical tropes have been well

931
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:52,960
described for over a century by scholars,

932
00:33:49,519 --> 00:33:55,120
by journalists, by activists... by regular

933
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:56,799
folks who consume art. There's enough

934
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:58,880
writing on the history and problems of

935
00:33:56,799 --> 00:34:01,600
black representation and media to fill

936
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:03,760
up several Hell Houses, but I liked the

937
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:05,760
CBC's brief exploration of black

938
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:07,519
representation in Hollywood films if you

939
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:09,200
want to dip your toes.

940
00:34:07,519 --> 00:34:10,960
Feel free to recommend readings in the

941
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:12,639
comments as well, for me and other

942
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:14,560
viewers.

943
00:34:12,639 --> 00:34:16,320
The issues with Remake's most prominent

944
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:18,720
instance of black representation have

945
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:20,399
been outlined by writers such as Jeffrey

946
00:34:18,720 --> 00:34:23,359
Rousseau in Ars Technica,

947
00:34:20,399 --> 00:34:25,520
and Norris Howard in Checkpoint XP.

948
00:34:23,359 --> 00:34:27,839
These issues go as far as the way

949
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:30,159
Barret's hair is rendered, as clarified

950
00:34:27,839 --> 00:34:32,879
in an illuminating conversation led by

951
00:34:30,159 --> 00:34:35,200
Austin Walker on Twitter.

952
00:34:32,879 --> 00:34:37,440
In short, Remake's Barret exhibits

953
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:39,679
exaggerated, relatively more emotive

954
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:41,040
speech that evokes a preacher from the

955
00:34:39,679 --> 00:34:43,520
U.S. South.

956
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:45,520
He channels the trope of the big scary

957
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:48,320
black man at points.

958
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:50,159
He also functions as comic relief by

959
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:51,839
doing things like singing Stamp the

960
00:34:50,159 --> 00:34:54,000
dog's theme song

961
00:34:51,839 --> 00:34:56,240
and the game's victory fanfare.

962
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:58,000
Prior to Remake, Barret already carried

963
00:34:56,240 --> 00:35:00,320
some baggage because of the way fans

964
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:02,640
associated him with Mr. T

965
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:05,440
from the popular 80s U.S. television

966
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:07,680
series A-Team. This association has been

967
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:09,440
acknowledged by Final Fantasy VII

968
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:12,960
character designer and writer Tetsuya

969
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:15,040
Nomura who wrote in 2006: "Barret is

970
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:16,720
often compared to a certain 'A-Team'

971
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:19,119
member."

972
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:21,920
Interesting to note is that Barret's 

973
00:35:19,119 --> 00:35:24,160
Mr.T-esque dialogue quirks in the original--

974
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:25,280
for example his tendency to call people

975
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:27,040
"fools"--

976
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:29,440
appears to be a consequence of the

977
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:31,280
English language localization

978
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:33,920
in playing the original in both English

979
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:36,079
and Japanese at the same time writer

980
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:38,560
Tim Rogers in Kotaku describes Barret

981
00:35:36,079 --> 00:35:41,280
coming off as more of a serious military

982
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:43,440
man in the original Japanese.

983
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:45,599
For all of Remake Barret's good scenes

984
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:47,680
and dialogue, the Remake team did a

985
00:35:45,599 --> 00:35:49,040
pretty poor job at shaking off this

986
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:52,000
baggage.

987
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:54,240
While he isn't emulating Mr. T anymore, as

988
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:56,079
Jeffrey Rousseau points out, his voice

989
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:59,119
still oozes black exploitation

990
00:35:56,079 --> 00:36:01,359
characters of the 70s. I've seen attempts

991
00:35:59,119 --> 00:36:03,040
by commenters to downplay the issue in

992
00:36:01,359 --> 00:36:04,320
one of the referenced articles and the

993
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:06,640
Twitter thread.

994
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:08,400
The issue is hand waved as "Japanese

995
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:10,880
developers are making a product for

996
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:12,960
Japanese people first and foremost, they

997
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:15,440
can't be faulted for messing up Barret,"

998
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:17,359
"Japanese media has a poor track record

999

00:36:17,359 --> 00:36:21,440
non-Japanese ethnicity," "The concerns

1001

00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:25,520
people is a U.S. conceit that's out of

1003
00:36:23,599 --> 00:36:27,119
touch with the rest of the world," and so

1004
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:28,640
on.

1005
00:36:27,119 --> 00:36:30,560
But we're not talking about sheltered

1006
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:32,480
babies who happened to put together a

1007
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:33,599
video game that became an international

1008
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:36,079
hit.

1009
00:36:33,599 --> 00:36:38,160
This is a corporation that, despite being

1010
00:36:36,079 --> 00:36:41,119
at least peripherally aware of negative

1011
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:43,680
associations around Barret, still made a

1012
00:36:41,119 --> 00:36:46,800
deliberate decision to convey a black

1013
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:49,920
character in a stereotypical way.

1014
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:52,560
As Austin Walker writes: "You cannot give

1015
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:55,040
Barret a blaxploitation voice, make him

1016
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:58,560
speak with black slang and then pretend

1017
00:36:55,040 --> 00:37:00,400
that you don't owe anything to blackness."

1018
00:36:58,560 --> 00:37:01,760
Remake's failure to better engage with

1019
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:03,839
the blackness it borrows from

1020
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:06,320
unfortunately fits the same pattern of

1021
00:37:03,839 --> 00:37:08,400
failure in mainstream media.

1022
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:10,400
There's one last facet of Remake Barret

1023
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:12,000
that I'll talk about, and it lies at the

1024
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:13,599
intersection of two dimensions we've

1025
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:15,200
already talked about.

1026
00:37:13,599 --> 00:37:18,320
Let's look at a passage from political

1027
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:19,960
scientist Cedric Robinson's 1998 essay

1028
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:22,960
"Black Exploitation and the

1029
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:25,040
Misrepresentation of Liberation."

1030
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:27,760
Unfortunately this is the only work in

1031
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:29,520
this video that's paywalled: the essay is

1032
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:32,079
available in the collection Cedric J.

1033
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:34,839
Robinson: On Racial Capitalism, Black

Internationalism, and Cultures of

1035
00:37:34,839 --> 00:37:39,599
Resistance. If you have access to

1036
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:41,839
academic search engines, *any* academic

1037
00:37:39,599 --> 00:37:44,480
search engines, you can find the original

1038
00:37:41,839 --> 00:37:46,320
article by plugging in the title.

1039
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:49,839
I've transcribed the passage most

1040
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:51,680
relevant to this discussion in full:

1041
00:37:49,839 --> 00:37:53,839
One of the most effective and clever

1042
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:56,160
manoeuvres of the Blaxploitation genre

1043
00:37:53,839 --> 00:37:58,880
was the appropriation and representation

1044
00:37:56,160 --> 00:38:00,800
of Angela Davis's public image.

1045
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:02,480
This manipulation, of course, was of a

1046
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:04,880
piece with the commercial cinema's

1047
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:06,640
translation of the mass black rebellion

1048
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:08,560
which occurred near the end of the Civil

1049
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:10,160
Rights era...

1050
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:12,240
independent and then established

1051
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:14,640
film-makers trivialised the troubled

1052
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:16,839
activists of the movement into the now

1053
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:20,240
familiar male counter-revolutionary

1054
00:38:16,839 --> 00:38:22,800
creatures: the male prostitute ('Sweetback');

1055
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:26,160
the vigilante cops ('Gravedigger Jones' and

1056
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:30,400
'Coffin Ed Johnson'); the dope pusher ('Shaft');

1057
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:32,960
and the gangster ('Black Caesar', etc.)

1058
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:35,359
... Film however transported Davis's form from

1059
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:37,839
a representation of a revolutionist to

1060
00:38:35,359 --> 00:38:39,359
that of an erotic black nationalist,

1061
00:38:37,839 --> 00:38:41,599
largely devoid of historical

1062
00:38:39,359 --> 00:38:43,599
consciousness. This was achieved by

1063
00:38:41,599 --> 00:38:45,520
eviscerating the original's intellectual,

1064
00:38:43,599 --> 00:38:47,680
sophistication political and

1065
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:50,079
organisational context, doctrinal

1066
00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:52,320
commitments, and most tellingly, her

1067
00:38:50,079 --> 00:38:56,560
critique of capitalist society and its

1068
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:56,560
employment of gender, race and class."

1069
00:38:56,960 --> 00:39:01,359
Robinson goes on to specifically

1070
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:03,440
describe the eroticization of Angela

1071
00:39:01,359 --> 00:39:05,839
Davis in blaxploitation films through

1072
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:07,359
characters played by Pam Grier and

1073
00:39:05,839 --> 00:39:08,720
Rosalind Cash--

1074
00:39:07,359 --> 00:39:10,800
but what we're concerned about when it

1075
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:12,720
comes to Barret is the idea of black

1076
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:15,200
militants having their own image and

1077
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:16,800
their own systemic critiques caricatured

1078
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:19,119
when they're translated from real life

1079
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:20,640
to film.

1080
00:39:19,119 --> 00:39:22,720
When I look at Barret and all of his

1081
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:24,560
incarnations, original, Remake or

1082
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:27,200
otherwise, it's hard not to see

1083
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:29,200
Robinson's observations being practiced

1084
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:31,760
even if the underlying context and

1085
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:33,520
authorial intentions aren't 100% aligned

1086
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:34,800
with blaxploitation filmmakers of the

1087
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:36,160
70s,

1088
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:38,000
I think there's a throughline between

1089
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:40,160
the archetypical images of black

1090
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:42,960
militants in the United States from the

1091
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:45,040
60s and 70s and Barret.

1092
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:46,960
For the sake of my argument let's place

1093
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:49,119
the start of this throughline at the

1094
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:50,400
real-life black radicals of the 60s and

1095
00:39:49,119 --> 00:39:52,320
70s.

1096
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:54,560
those real-life people are transformed

1097
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:57,839
into political caricatures in the

1098
00:39:54,560 --> 00:40:00,720
blaxploitation films of the 70s and 80s.

1099
00:39:57,839 --> 00:40:02,400
One soon-to-be famous actor named Mr. T

1100
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:05,359
makes his Hollywood debut in the

1101
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:08,560
blaxploitation film Penitentiary II in

1102
00:40:05,359 --> 00:40:11,359
1982 before becoming a breakout star

1103
00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:13,920
with his role as Clubber Lang in 

1104
00:40:11,359 --> 00:40:16,079
Rocky III later that same year.

1105
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:17,839
Mr. T goes on to achieve lasting

1106
00:40:16,079 --> 00:40:21,440
international recognition with the

1107
00:40:17,839 --> 00:40:24,640
starring role on A-Team as B.A. Baracas

1108
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:27,440
from 1983 to 1987.

1109
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:30,000
The original Final Fantasy VII is released

1110
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:31,920
in 1997, about a decade after the end of

1111
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:33,920
A-Team, and one of the first party

1112
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:35,680
members you meet in the game, one of the

1113
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:38,720
first party members conceived for the

1114
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:41,280
game, is Barret Wallace. Here, we have a

1115
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:43,119
character who evokes Mr. T visually,

1116
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:45,040
channels Mr. T and blaxploitation

1117
00:40:43,119 --> 00:40:47,119
characters in his dialogue,

1118
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:48,960
and has some of the anti-capitalist

1119
00:40:47,119 --> 00:40:52,079
politics of those real-life black

1120
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:54,160
radicals from the 60s and 70s.

1121
00:40:52,079 --> 00:40:56,160
I presented this timeline in a linear

1122
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:58,319
way, but the argument is not intended to

1123
00:40:56,160 --> 00:40:59,200
be a straight trip from "point A" to 

1124
00:40:58,319 --> 00:41:01,760
"point B" --

1125
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:03,599
it's more of a confluence of factors,

1126
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:05,839
some connected, like black radicals and

1127
00:41:03,599 --> 00:41:07,920
their blaxploitation counterparts, and

1128
00:41:05,839 --> 00:41:10,480
some parallel, like the inauguration of

1129
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:12,880
Mr. T into the popular consciousness.

1130
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:15,200
But I do see Barrett Wallace as a result

1131
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:18,319
of this confluence.

1132
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:20,240
From 1997, let's skip straight to 2021,

1133
00:41:18,319 --> 00:41:22,240
where the somewhat de-politicized

1134
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:24,400
Barret of the original game has become

1135
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:25,680
the even more depoliticized Barret of

1136
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:28,000
Remake.

1137
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:30,079
And remember this depoliticization is

1138
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:32,400
relative to his real-life radical

1139
00:41:30,079 --> 00:41:34,720
progenitors, not a total judgment of the

1140
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:36,560
two Barrets' politics.

1141
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:38,800
This contrast really helps bring into

1142
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:41,440
high relief the idea, partly informed by

1143
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:43,440
Dr. Robinson, that the act of translating

1144
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:45,520
revolutionary politics to mainstream

1145
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:48,079
media causes those politics to be

1146
00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:49,280
watered down or caricatured in the final

1147
00:41:48,079 --> 00:41:51,200
product.

1148
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:53,839
I guess there's one outstanding question

1149
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:56,160
that i've been eliding this whole time:

1150
00:41:53,839 --> 00:41:59,520
"Is Barret's portrayal in Final Fantasy

1151
00:41:56,160 --> 00:41:59,520
VII Remake racist?"

1152
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:02,920
*Yes*

1153
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:09,440
Chapter 5: People of Midgar

1154
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:11,680
I said earlier that there are a few

1155
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:14,160
small issues that prevent me, a person of

1156
00:42:11,680 --> 00:42:16,480
authority, from canonizing Final Fantasy

1157
00:42:14,160 --> 00:42:18,079
VII as a Marxist game.

1158
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:19,119
Let's get the obvious issues out of the

1159
00:42:18,079 --> 00:42:22,000
way:

1160
00:42:19,119 --> 00:42:24,160
1. Neither Nojima, Nomura, Toriyama,

1161
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:25,839
nor any of the senior production staff

1162
00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:28,079
involved in the Compilation of Final

1163
00:42:25,839 --> 00:42:30,400
Fantasy VII have ever publicly

1164
00:42:28,079 --> 00:42:33,040
communicated an overtly left-wing

1165
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:35,760
intent or inspiration in conveying the

1166
00:42:33,040 --> 00:42:38,720
world of Final Fantasy VII.

1167
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:40,560
As a bit of a leftist myself I often

1168
00:42:38,720 --> 00:42:42,800
have to remind myself that sometimes,

1169
00:42:40,560 --> 00:42:45,040
popular media can just make radical

1170
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:47,119
points without necessarily being on the

1171
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:48,480
side of international communist

1172
00:42:47,119 --> 00:42:50,480
revolution.

1173
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:52,480
Like, it's definitely okay for John

1174
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:55,119
Oliver to point out contradictions in

1175
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:56,800
capitalism in his weekly show without

1176
00:42:55,119 --> 00:42:58,960
taking that extra half-step and

1177
00:42:56,800 --> 00:43:01,200
indicting the whole damn system.

1178
00:42:58,960 --> 00:43:03,440
It's okay for John Oliver to present

1179
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:05,280
issues in such a way that the viewer is

1180
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:07,440
guided towards interrogating the system

1181
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:08,960
that created those issues--the system

1182
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:11,119
being capitalism--

1183
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:13,680
without John Oliver himself actually

1184
00:43:11,119 --> 00:43:15,359
condemning capitalism.

1185
00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:18,240
It's OK for John Oliver to not be

1186
00:43:15,359 --> 00:43:18,240
communist, okay?

1187
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:23,280
2. The original's overt

1188
00:43:20,720 --> 00:43:25,119
anti-capitalist themes fall off a bit

1189
00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:27,200
after the Midgar section.

1190
00:43:25,119 --> 00:43:29,520
We'll see how the Remake series handles

1191
00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:31,520
these themes in subsequent releases, but

1192
00:43:29,520 --> 00:43:34,560
from what I remember of the original,

1193
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:36,160
the game's themes pivot to Cloud's past,

1194
00:43:34,560 --> 00:43:39,760
Aerith's future,

1195
00:43:36,160 --> 00:43:44,079
and the pursuit of Sephiroth, or the Path

1196
00:43:39,760 --> 00:43:46,560
of Sephirot if you're a Xenogears fan.

1197
00:43:44,079 --> 00:43:49,440
Does that even make sense?

1198
00:43:46,560 --> 00:43:51,440
Let me know in the comments, will you?

1199
00:43:49,440 --> 00:43:53,040
Shinra largely leaves the foreground for

1200
00:43:51,440 --> 00:43:55,119
the next part of the game, with a few

1201
00:43:53,040 --> 00:43:57,040
exceptions like the Corel Village plot

1202
00:43:55,119 --> 00:43:58,240
and the backstory around the Wutai side-

1203
00:43:57,040 --> 00:44:00,400
quests

1204
00:43:58,240 --> 00:44:02,079
By far the largest demerit I could levy

1205
00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:04,400
against the argument that "Remake is a

1206
00:44:02,079 --> 00:44:06,480
Marxist game" is this

1207
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:08,640
3. The people of Midgar don't participate

1208
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:11,280
in their own liberation. To begin

1209
00:44:08,640 --> 00:44:13,440
unpacking this, I ask you this question:

1210
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:15,359
can you recall any instances of regular

1211
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:18,079
ole' residents of Midgar in Final

1212
00:44:15,359 --> 00:44:19,920
Fantasy VII organizing themselves?

1213
00:44:18,079 --> 00:44:21,200
We don't see people clamoring to join

1214
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:23,440
Avalanche.

1215
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:25,440
The most grassroots form of activity we

1216
00:44:23,440 --> 00:44:27,119
see is the work of the Neighborhood

1217
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:29,040
Watch in Sector 7,

1218
00:44:27,119 --> 00:44:31,520
a community defense organization that

1219
00:44:29,040 --> 00:44:33,119
patrols and exterminates monsters.

1220
00:44:31,520 --> 00:44:35,680
Meanwhile, we're told that avalanche

1221
00:44:33,119 --> 00:44:37,359
levies demands like workers' rights, we

1222
00:44:35,680 --> 00:44:38,960
never get more information about

1223
00:44:37,359 --> 00:44:41,680
Avalanche's praxis around these

1224
00:44:38,960 --> 00:44:43,680
demands, nor information on how Midgar

1225
00:44:41,680 --> 00:44:45,760
residents participate in advocating

1226
00:44:43,680 --> 00:44:47,359
these demands for themselves.

1227
00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:49,440
There isn't a great sense that the

1228
00:44:47,359 --> 00:44:51,359
residents of Midgar stand in solidarity

1229
00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:53,040
with Avalanche, something that's

1230
00:44:51,359 --> 00:44:54,720
especially made apparent in the

1231
00:44:53,040 --> 00:44:57,680
incidental dialogue from Midgar

1232
00:44:54,720 --> 00:44:59,839
residents after the Sector 7 plate fall.

1233
00:44:57,680 --> 00:45:02,079
So we conclude that Avalanche is the

1234
00:44:59,839 --> 00:45:05,040
primary, if not sole group of people

1235
00:45:02,079 --> 00:45:06,800
agitating for radical change in Midgar.

1236
00:45:05,040 --> 00:45:08,520
We also conclude that Avalanche and

1237
00:45:06,800 --> 00:45:10,079
Midgar residents don't have much

1238
00:45:08,520 --> 00:45:12,400
cross-pollination by way of

1239
00:45:10,079 --> 00:45:15,200
collaboration going on.

1240
00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:17,280
This is just not a Marxist relation nor

1241
00:45:15,200 --> 00:45:18,960
is it a strong portrayal of radical

1242
00:45:17,280 --> 00:45:20,400
politics.

1243
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:22,640
You'll remember from our discussion of

1244
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:25,200
Marxist thought that workers are named

1245
00:45:22,640 --> 00:45:28,160
the agents of radical change. 

1246
00:45:25,200 --> 00:45:30,720
To paraphrase the Communist Manifesto:

1247
00:45:28,160 --> 00:45:32,720
"Communists have no interest separate and

1248
00:45:30,720 --> 00:45:33,839
apart from those of the workers as a

1249
00:45:32,720 --> 00:45:36,240
whole...

1250
00:45:33,839 --> 00:45:38,079
The immediate aim of the communists is

1251
00:45:36,240 --> 00:45:39,200
the formation of the workers into a

1252
00:45:38,079 --> 00:45:41,839
class,

1253
00:45:39,200 --> 00:45:45,359
overthrow of ruling class supremacy and

1254
00:45:41,839 --> 00:45:46,880
conquest of political power by workers."

1255
00:45:45,359 --> 00:45:48,480
There's no doubt that the Avalanche

1256
00:45:46,880 --> 00:45:50,720
members we know intimately are

1257
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:52,800
reflective of workers in Midgar, with

1258
00:45:50,720 --> 00:45:55,359
Biggs being a former teacher,

1259
00:45:52,800 --> 00:45:57,040
Jesse being a former actor, and 

1260
00:45:55,359 --> 00:45:59,520
Tifa being a bartender,

1261
00:45:57,040 --> 00:46:01,680
Cloud being a Shinra Public...

1262
00:45:59,520 --> 00:46:03,680
SOLDIER First Class.

1263
00:46:01,680 --> 00:46:05,920
But all the revolutionary activity that

1264
00:46:03,680 --> 00:46:08,240
happens in Midgar begins and ends with

1265
00:46:05,920 --> 00:46:09,920
Avalanche. We don't see other Midgar

1266
00:46:08,240 --> 00:46:12,160
residents get involved or become

1267
00:46:09,920 --> 00:46:14,079
radicalized by Avalanche.

1268
00:46:12,160 --> 00:46:16,560
Regular ole' Midgar residents don't

1269
00:46:14,079 --> 00:46:18,160
exhibit any revolutionary agency towards

1270
00:46:16,560 --> 00:46:21,200
their own liberation.

1271
00:46:18,160 --> 00:46:23,040
There's no self-determination!

1272
00:46:21,200 --> 00:46:25,680
I know what you're thinking: "a work

1273
00:46:23,040 --> 00:46:26,960
doesn't need to be 'Marxist' to be radical" 

1274
00:46:25,680 --> 00:46:28,960
-- and I agree.

1275
00:46:26,960 --> 00:46:30,319
I do think Marxism is a useful lens

1276
00:46:28,960 --> 00:46:32,240
through which we can assess a work's

1277
00:46:30,319 --> 00:46:34,640
radical qualities, especially given the

1278
00:46:32,240 --> 00:46:35,839
way these games evoke anti-

1279
00:46:34,640 --> 00:46:38,240
capitalist ideas.

1280
00:46:35,839 --> 00:46:40,480
Deploying that lens magnifies that last

1281
00:46:38,240 --> 00:46:42,160
demerit I described - that the people who

1282
00:46:40,480 --> 00:46:44,160
would benefit from their own liberation

1283
00:46:42,160 --> 00:46:46,640
are never significantly involved or

1284
00:46:44,160 --> 00:46:48,000
represented among the ranks of Avalanche,

1285
00:46:46,640 --> 00:46:50,240
who have taken on the mantle of

1286
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:52,480
liberator. There is probably some radical

1287
00:46:50,240 --> 00:46:55,200
tradition or theory that reconciles this

1288
00:46:52,480 --> 00:46:57,680
imbalanced relationship to make it work,

1289
00:46:55,200 --> 00:46:59,680
but it's hard for me to co-sign the idea

1290
00:46:57,680 --> 00:47:01,359
that a handful of special folks

1291
00:46:59,680 --> 00:47:03,760
shepherding the rest of us into a

1292
00:47:01,359 --> 00:47:05,520
brighter future is a particularly

1293
00:47:03,760 --> 00:47:07,680
radical idea.

1294
00:47:05,520 --> 00:47:11,839
With that, I guess it's about time we

1295
00:47:07,680 --> 00:47:11,839
answered that one question, isn't it?

1296
00:47:12,640 --> 00:47:16,880
Chapter 6:

1297
00:47:14,079 --> 00:47:16,880
The Answer

1298
00:47:17,520 --> 00:47:21,920
We've reached the end of our journey

1299
00:47:19,040 --> 00:47:24,640
together and look how far we've come:

1300
00:47:21,920 --> 00:47:26,480
we've vivisected a radical heart, we've

1301
00:47:24,640 --> 00:47:28,160
shattered a radical mirror,

1302
00:47:26,480 --> 00:47:31,119
we've bullied the man with the machine

1303
00:47:28,160 --> 00:47:33,040
gun arm, and most importantly we've saved

1304
00:47:31,119 --> 00:47:34,960
an innocent video game from being

1305
00:47:33,040 --> 00:47:36,559
labeled "Marxist."

1306
00:47:34,960 --> 00:47:38,559
I'm sure you're clamoring to hear a

1307
00:47:36,559 --> 00:47:39,920
definitive answer to the question in the

1308
00:47:38,559 --> 00:47:42,960
title of the video:

1309
00:47:39,920 --> 00:47:44,160
"Is Final Fantasy VII a Radical Left-Wing

1310
00:47:42,960 --> 00:47:45,839
Game?"

1311
00:47:44,160 --> 00:47:47,680
But before we put our stamp on the

1312
00:47:45,839 --> 00:47:50,079
question once and for all, I think it's

1313
00:47:47,680 --> 00:47:52,079
worth noting a couple of things:

1314
00:47:50,079 --> 00:47:54,480
First, a handful of you, including my

1315
00:47:52,079 --> 00:47:56,079
Developmental Editor Elizabeth

1316
00:47:54,480 --> 00:47:58,720
might be annoyed that I spent a lot of

1317
00:47:56,079 --> 00:48:01,280
time talking about the "Content" of Final

1318
00:47:58,720 --> 00:48:03,520
Fantasy VII without even touching the

1319
00:48:01,280 --> 00:48:06,880
"Form" of Final Fantasy VII.

1320
00:48:03,520 --> 00:48:08,559
To quote Elizabeth's notes on this video:

1321
00:48:06,880 --> 00:48:10,960
"I think part of the analysis of a work

1322
00:48:08,559 --> 00:48:12,640
of art's politics is not just its content

1323
00:48:10,960 --> 00:48:14,400
[what the game is about, the issues it

1324
00:48:12,640 --> 00:48:16,960
deals with, what the plot and characters

1325
00:48:14,400 --> 00:48:19,599
show about the politics of the work, etc.]

1326
00:48:16,960 --> 00:48:21,520
but its form. For instance, what kind of

1327
00:48:19,599 --> 00:48:23,680
narrative it is, how does its genre

1328
00:48:21,520 --> 00:48:25,520
influence the story being told, what kind

1329
00:48:23,680 --> 00:48:28,000
of interactions does it create with its

1330
00:48:25,520 --> 00:48:30,480
audience, what kind of 'subject' interacts

1331
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:33,200
with it and interprets it and how;

1332
00:48:30,480 --> 00:48:35,280
also who produces it, how it's produced

1333
00:48:33,200 --> 00:48:38,319
why societies turn to certain kinds of

1334
00:48:35,280 --> 00:48:40,400
art (such as video games) at certain times."

1335
00:48:38,319 --> 00:48:43,040
The relationship of "Form" and "Content"

1336
00:48:40,400 --> 00:48:45,200
comes out of the writings of G. W. F. Hegel

1337
00:48:43,040 --> 00:48:47,200
and Marxist thinkers like Theodor

1338
00:48:45,200 --> 00:48:48,960
Adorno, and it's definitely something i

1339
00:48:47,200 --> 00:48:50,880
could stand to learn more about.

1340
00:48:48,960 --> 00:48:52,960
I'm leaving this as an open thread for

1341
00:48:50,880 --> 00:48:56,160
folks to discuss and I might pick it

1342
00:48:52,960 --> 00:48:58,800
back up for a new video in the future.

1343
00:48:56,160 --> 00:49:01,040
Second, let's be mindful of our tendency

1344
00:48:58,800 --> 00:49:03,359
as left-wing consumers and critics to

1345
00:49:01,040 --> 00:49:05,599
impute certain political conclusions to

1346
00:49:03,359 --> 00:49:07,520
works of art that we enjoy.

1347
00:49:05,599 --> 00:49:09,839
Take the statement by English professor

1348
00:49:07,520 --> 00:49:11,920
Nicola Nixon:

1349
00:49:09,839 --> 00:49:14,079
"The conflation of aesthetic appreciation

1350
00:49:11,920 --> 00:49:16,079
and good politics surfaces in certain

1351
00:49:14,079 --> 00:49:18,480
critics as a form of leftist wish

1352
00:49:16,079 --> 00:49:20,640
fulfillment... in other words, if one likes

1353
00:49:18,480 --> 00:49:22,800
the fiction, it must necessarily involve

1354
00:49:20,640 --> 00:49:25,200
the articulation of a perceptible,

1355
00:49:22,800 --> 00:49:27,839
revolutionary project."

1356
00:49:25,200 --> 00:49:29,680
Definitely a mood. I often have to stop

1357
00:49:27,839 --> 00:49:31,119
myself from running too wild with my

1358
00:49:29,680 --> 00:49:32,960
left-wing wish fulfillment when I

1359
00:49:31,119 --> 00:49:36,000
brainstorm and write up outlines for my

1360
00:49:32,960 --> 00:49:37,680
videos. As a leftist, I think it's fun to

1361
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:39,839
recognize and appreciate radical

1362
00:49:37,680 --> 00:49:42,160
left-wing elements in a work, whether

1363
00:49:39,839 --> 00:49:44,240
it's anti-capitalist themes, rhetoric

1364
00:49:42,160 --> 00:49:46,240
about things like "workers' rights," and

1365
00:49:44,240 --> 00:49:47,920
relations that mirror relations we see

1366
00:49:46,240 --> 00:49:49,760
in history.

1367
00:49:47,920 --> 00:49:51,920
I think I would conclude that Final

1368
00:49:49,760 --> 00:49:54,559
Fantasy VII doesn't use its radical

1369
00:49:51,920 --> 00:49:56,720
left-wing elements as set dressing, but

1370
00:49:54,559 --> 00:49:58,559
makes those elements crucial to the

1371
00:49:56,720 --> 00:50:00,800
existence of its world:

1372
00:49:58,559 --> 00:50:03,440
look towards Midgar, the Shinra Company,

1373
00:50:00,800 --> 00:50:05,280
and Avalanche as examples.

1374
00:50:03,440 --> 00:50:06,240
That said, having reviewed the body of

1375
00:50:05,280 --> 00:50:08,960
evidence,

1376
00:50:06,240 --> 00:50:11,839
I don't think Final Fantasy VII - the

1377
00:50:08,960 --> 00:50:14,800
original, Remake Part 1, any iteration -

1378
00:50:11,839 --> 00:50:16,079
can be called a radical left-wing game.

1379
00:50:14,800 --> 00:50:18,160
I don't think there's enough being done

1380
00:50:16,079 --> 00:50:20,400
by the game to synthesize its left-wing

1381
00:50:18,160 --> 00:50:22,319
elements into a conclusion about the

1382
00:50:20,400 --> 00:50:23,839
nature of our world.

1383
00:50:22,319 --> 00:50:26,400
The game doesn't have to be an

1384
00:50:23,839 --> 00:50:28,240
on-the-nose satire to achieve this,

1385
00:50:26,400 --> 00:50:30,960
but it's telling to me that the game's

1386
00:50:28,240 --> 00:50:32,880
various anti-capitalist aspects tend to

1387
00:50:30,960 --> 00:50:36,000
converge towards the conclusion that

1388
00:50:32,880 --> 00:50:38,079
Shinra is the problem and not capitalism

1389
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:40,960
generally, limiting the scope of the

1390
00:50:38,079 --> 00:50:42,319
game's message to a specific evil inside

1391
00:50:40,960 --> 00:50:44,960
of its own world.

1392
00:50:42,319 --> 00:50:47,359
However, I will say that Final Fantasy

1393
00:50:44,960 --> 00:50:49,440
VII is a damn fine game,

1394
00:50:47,359 --> 00:50:52,240
leftist gamers don't have to limit

1395
00:50:49,440 --> 00:50:54,400
themselves to ideologically pure or even

1396
00:50:52,240 --> 00:50:56,640
ideologically coherent games,

1397
00:50:54,400 --> 00:50:58,720
and you can literally operate a sewer

1398
00:50:56,640 --> 00:51:00,079
system's water pump with your girlfriend

1399
00:50:58,720 --> 00:51:01,359
in Remake.

1400
00:51:00,079 --> 00:51:03,119
Play the game.

1401
00:51:01,359 --> 00:51:05,040
play InterMISSION.

1402
00:51:03,119 --> 00:51:07,839
Just go and do it.

1403
00:51:05,040 --> 00:51:10,319
And most importantly, get involved with a

1404
00:51:07,839 --> 00:51:12,559
left organization in your area.

1405
00:51:10,319 --> 00:51:15,040
If you live in the United States, look up

1406
00:51:12,559 --> 00:51:16,880
who's active in your area, see what kind

1407
00:51:15,040 --> 00:51:18,800
of work they do around the specific

1408
00:51:16,880 --> 00:51:20,319
issues that you're interested in whether

1409
00:51:18,800 --> 00:51:23,200
it's the environment

1410
00:51:20,319 --> 00:51:25,040
anti-racism or abortion rights--and see

1411
00:51:23,200 --> 00:51:26,960
how you can get involved.

1412
00:51:25,040 --> 00:51:29,040
The good organizations will typically

1413
00:51:26,960 --> 00:51:30,960
have some sort of political education

1414
00:51:29,040 --> 00:51:32,800
program which might cover some of the

1415
00:51:30,960 --> 00:51:35,520
real life events and topics I've

1416
00:51:32,800 --> 00:51:37,440
discussed in this video.

1417
00:51:35,520 --> 00:51:39,760
If you live in the United States, the

1418
00:51:37,440 --> 00:51:42,079
Democratic Socialists of America has

1419
00:51:39,760 --> 00:51:45,520
chapters in states across the country -

1420
00:51:42,079 --> 00:51:47,599
shoutout to the AFROSOC caucus.

1421
00:51:45,520 --> 00:51:49,200
Don't discount smaller groups either,

1422
00:51:47,599 --> 00:51:51,839
even if it's just a once a month reading

1423
00:51:49,200 --> 00:51:53,760
group -- it's so useful to learn with a

1424
00:51:51,839 --> 00:51:56,720
group of people, to have conversations

1425
00:51:53,760 --> 00:51:59,200
and debates, to become activated!

1426
00:51:56,720 --> 00:52:01,359
Because everything I've described--from

1427
00:51:59,200 --> 00:52:03,359
the exploitation of the poor, to the

1428
00:52:01,359 --> 00:52:05,760
destruction of the environment--

1429
00:52:03,359 --> 00:52:07,440
can only be stopped if we organize

1430
00:52:05,760 --> 00:52:09,839
ourselves.

1431
00:52:07,440 --> 00:52:11,680
To paraphrase Barret and Aerith at

1432
00:52:09,839 --> 00:52:13,359
different points in Remake:

1433
00:52:11,680 --> 00:52:15,440
"We don't want to look back one day and

1434
00:52:13,359 --> 00:52:18,240
wish we'd done it differently

1435
00:52:15,440 --> 00:52:19,599
right here, right now, we need to keep

1436
00:52:18,240 --> 00:52:23,960
moving forward,

1437
00:52:19,599 --> 00:52:43,040
so we can say we did *everything* we could.
